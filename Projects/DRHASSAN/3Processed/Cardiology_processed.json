        "correct_choice": "Correct answer is c.",
        "reasoning": "Ivabradine use may be associated with visual disturbances including phosphenes and green luminescence\n\nIvabradine is a second line agent for rate control in the treatment of chronic heart failure in those in whom beta-blockade is contraindicated, not tolerated or therapy fails. Other rate limiting drugs such as the calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil may sometimes be used but hypotension often limits their use. Digoxin too can sometimes be used, even in sinus rhythm although the rate limiting effect it has is relatively modest; often digoxin and ivabradine are ultimately used in conjunction.\n\nNICE guidelines on the use of ivabradine give clear criteria on its use; the patient must have at least a moderate degree of heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fracture of <35%, they must be stable on optimal doses of other heart failure medications including angiotensin system modulators, an aldosterone receptor antagonist and a beta blocker if not contraindicated. It is important the patient is regularly monitored by a community heart failure team to titrate the dose. Ivabradine can also only be used in patients in sinus rhythm. It works by selectively inhibiting the If [ionic funny] channel which is a sodium/potassium symporter channel largely expressed within the sinoatrial node. Inhibition of this channel slows the intrinsic rhythmicity of the hearts pacemaker function. Pharmaceutical bradycardia aids in the management of cardiac failure as it allows improved diastolic filling and reduced myocardial oxygen usage.\n\nSide effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, ventricular escape rhythms, dizziness, headache, muscle cramps and eosinophilia. Neutrophilia is rarely seen with ivabradine. Hypotension is also not seen with ivabradine use which makes it an important drug in the arsenal when treating patients with cardiac failure in whom other rate limiting drugs may be relatively contraindicated.\n\nAn important side effect with ivabradine however is that of visual disturbance including the phenomenon of phosphenes, or 'flashing lights'. Other visual symptoms described include green discolouration of visual field, blurring of vision and scintillating scotomata. These visual symptoms are usually transient and mild. They arise due to inhibition of similar ionic funny channels in the retina to the sinoatrial If channels. Approximately 20% of patients taking the drug develop some form of visual disturbance but only 1% need to discontinue therapy because of it.\n\nThe use of ivabradine in renal dysfunction is not well established however manufacturers recommend it may be used with estimated glomerular filtration rates above 15ml/min. There is no evidence its use causes renal dysfunction although mild rises in plasma creatinine levels may be seen.",

He reports he recently had a productive cough with coryzal symptoms for the last 3-4 days but he feels it is improving.

        "correct_choice": "Correct answer is c.",
        "reasoning": "This patient has presented with symptoms and typical ECG changes in keeping with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The thickening of the cardiac muscle is most likely a result of chronic uncontrolled hypertension, hence the prolonged, progressive history. LV hypertrophy results in signs and symptoms of LV failure including breathlessness, angina and reduced exercise tolerance. The patient's ECG demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with ST elevation in V2-3, without reciprocal lead changes and the combination of the S wave in V1 with the R wave in V5 or V6 clearly exceeding 40 mm.\n\nBrugada syndrome is a genetic cardiac disorder resulting in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death. There are several types of Brugada syndrome with variation seen on ECG however the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as Brugada sign.\n\nThere is no clear reason why this patient would be hyperkalaemia. Although he has renal impairment it is not indicated that he has end-stage renal failure or that he is on renal replacement therapy therefore hyperkalaemia would not be expected. Common ECG changes noted in hyperkalaemia included peaked T waves, P wave widening/flattening, PR prolongation progressing to the bradyarrhythmias and conductions blocks. No clear features of hyperkalaemia can be seen on this patient's ECG.\n\nPericarditis is inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart and can be due to infections. Patients normally present with pleuritic, constant chest pain and fevers. Although this patient has a very recent chest infection, pericarditis normally develops a few weeks post the resolution of infection as it is an immune response and not a direct result of the infection itself. ECG findings associated with pericarditis include widespread concave ST elevation and PR depression which are not present on this patient's ECG.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic like symptoms. You would expect the patient's chest pain to be continuous and to be more severe if he was experiencing stenosis of the LAD.",

ARVD can present as palpitations, syncope, or sudden cardiac death similar to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Over time, the right ventricular myocardium is replaced by fibrofatty tissue and patients develop signs of right ventricular failure. This patient's echocardiogram finding of a hypokinetic right ventricular wall is suggestive of the diagnosis. The most characteristic ECG finding in ARVD is an epsilon wave . An epsilon wave is a positive deflection following the end of the QRS complex caused by post-excitation of right ventricular myocytes.\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is a common ECG finding of HOCM . HOCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death and can also present with palpitations and syncope, as seen in this patient. However, this patient's echocardiogram findings are in keeping with ARVD, of which the epsilon wave is the most characteristic ECG finding.\n\nAn Osborn wave (or J wave) is a positive deflection at the J point.

In ARVD, rather than hypertrophy of the right ventricle, the myocardium is replaced by fatty tissue. Right bundle branch block is not a sign of ARVD. Instead, the left bundle branch block is more likely to feature on an ECG of a patient with ARVD.\n\nA delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is commonly associated with pre-excitatory activity, such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome.

        "correct_choice": "Correct Answer: d",
        "reasoning": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy - T wave inversion in V1-3. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterised by the replacement of the myocardium of the right ventricle with fibrofatty tissue. The abnormal fibrofatty tissue predisposes to ventricular tachycardia (VT), right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and can cause sudden death. It is often inherited but can be sporadic. Presentation is often with nonspecific palpitations, chest discomfort, and syncope. This patient has a typical presentation: the pregnancyassociated increase in stroke volume is likely the trigger for her symptoms recently worsening. Her two ECGs are characteristic: typical changes include inverted T waves in the precordial leads V1-V3 (looking at the right ventricle) with episodes of ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricle (giving the ECG a LBBB morphology as the arrhythmia takes an abnormal route of conduction from right to left through slowly-conducting myocardium rather than conducting tissue). Epsilon waves may also be seen in ARVC. Her echocardiogram is also characteristic - infiltration and thinning of the right ventricular wall can occur to the point that systolic function is impaired and an aneurysm forms.\n\nNote that the differential for a wide-complex regular tachycardia on an ECG includes SVT with aberrant conduction (as well as VT). However, the fusion beats and capture beats are more in keeping with VT in this case.\n\nThis patient's presentation is not typical for aortic dissection. An echo might see cardiac tamponade or new aortic regurgitation if this was the diagnosis but this is not the case here.\n\nTakutsubo cardiomyopathy is caused by transient systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), presenting similarly to an acute coronary syndrome. Patients typically have chest pain, a raised troponin, and ECG findings consistent with ischaemia such as ST elevation/T wave inversion. This is typically triggered by recent physical or emotional stress. Patients are initially managed as an ACS but cardiac angiography shows no significant coronary artery disease. Instead, the LV wall shows hypokinesis or akinesis which creates the shape of an 'octopus pot' during systole. It may be argued that this patient has experienced a recent stressor (the news of pregnancy) however her presentation, long history of symptoms, and echo findings are more in keeping with AVRC.\n\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare type of cardiomyopathy that is often dilated and occurs in late pregnancy or early postpartum (typically one month before or after birth). The aetiology is unclear but is thought to be multifactorial. Criteria for diagnosis of PPCM include impairment of LV systolic function (LVEF <45%) which was not the case in this patient. Furthermore, this patient presented in the early second trimester - too early for PPCM but late enough for pregnancyrelated haemodynamic changes to trigger her underlying ARVC.\n\nLastly, Brugada syndrome is another important differential to consider in young patients with palpitations, ECG changes in V1-V3, and episodes of VT. Brugada is caused by an inherited mutation in the cardiac sodium channel. However, echocardiography is typically normal and an ECG may show unusual ST elevation in V1-V3 with T wave inversion in these leads.",

        "updated_reasoning": "The most likely diagnosis is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) due to T wave inversion in V1-V3, wide complex tachycardia originating from the right ventricle (LBBB morphology), and echocardiogram findings (dilated RV, apical aneurysm). Aortic dissection is less likely given the absence of typical presentation/echo findings. Takutsubo is less likely because of long history of symptoms, and echo findings.

In this situation, unstable VT with a pulse should be managed with synchronised DC cardioversion.

        "reasoning": "This patient has presented with features in keeping with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The condition is due to a genetic defect that causes a disorder of the cardiac muscle and, although patients can be asymptomatic, it is the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Patients who do present with symptoms typically experience exertional dyspnoea, angina and syncopal episodes, commonly following or during exertion. ECG findings are of left ventricular hypertrophy, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion and deep Q waves. On this patient's ECG widespread T wave inversion can be seen, especially in lead I & II as well as nonspecific ST-segment changes in V2 & 3. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cardiac echo and management is dependant on the extent of obstruction and patient symptoms.\n\nBrugada syndrome is another genetic cardiac disorder however unlike HOCM it results in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death however it is not always associated with exertion or exercise. There are several types of Brugada syndrome, each with variations seen on ECG. However, the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as the Brugada sign.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial and characterised by progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Presentation is normal with worsening biventricular failure including peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Syncope episodes are rare and symptoms are not fluctuant, as seen in this patient. ECG abnormalities are those associated with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with conduction delays (e.g. LBBB), left axis deviation and poor R wave progression.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), is a result of a genetic defect affecting the desmosomes of the myocardium. ARVD results in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, mainly affecting the right ventricle. The condition leads to hypokinetic areas of the ventricle wall and myocardium fibrofatty replacement with which results in associated arrhythmias. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncope, and potentially sudden cardiac death however ECG findings are of T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3 and of right bundle branch block which are not present in this case.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic-like symptoms .",

Lastly, the capillary wedge pressure is equivalent to the left atrial pressure, which should also be the same as the left ventricular diastolic pressure. A normal mitral valve expects less than 5mmHg pressure difference.

        "reasoning": "This patient has Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome a pre-excitation syndrome that causes clinical features of palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain and in severe cases collapse and shock, including cardiac arrest. Wolff-Parkinson White is caused by an accessory pathway conducting impulses from the sinoatrial node to the ventricles giving rise to an atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia. ECG features include a shortened PR interval, left axis deviation or right axis deviation (depending on the location of the accessory pathway) and a widened QRS complex from the 'delta' wave (a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex). The delta wave can be seen in this patient's ECG, along with a shortened PR interval.\n\nAccelerated junctional rhythm is incorrect. Accelerated junctional rhythm is when the atrioventricular node conducts at a faster rate than the sinoatrial node. This gives rise to an ECG with appearances of a narrow complex rhythm, with a ventricular rate between 60-100 beats/min. Retrograde P waves can be seen. Causes include digoxin toxicity, beta-blockers and myocardial ischaemia.\n\nAtrial flutter is incorrect. Atrial flutter is an irregular supraventricular arrhythmia. Although it can cause similar symptoms to those experienced by the patient, a characteristic ECG finding is a saw-tooth appearance of the baseline of the ECG which is not seen here.\n\nNormal sinus rhythm is incorrect. Although the patient's rhythm is sinus with QRS complexes following a P wave. There are clear delta waves preceding the QRS complexes that are consistent with Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome.\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is incorrect. SVT is caused by a re-entry circuit within the atrioventricular node. This is in contrast to atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia which is caused by an accessory conducting pathway (e.g. Wolff-\n\nParkinson White syndrome). Symptoms are similar to this patient's presentation with palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain that may be exacerbated by caffeine or alcohol. However, the presence of a delta wave is more suggestive of an accessory conducting pathway, making supraventricular tachycardia.",

This patient fits into this category due to his age, sex, and lack of other risk factors. The CT coronary angiogram will help visualise the coronary arteries and identify any significant stenosis.\n\nTreadmill ECG was once a common initial test for angina but it has now been superseded by more accurate tests such as CT coronary angiography. Treadmill ECG can have false positives and negatives, hence it is not recommended as a firstline investigation by NICE.\n\nA Trans-thoracic echocardiogram is useful in assessing cardiac function but it does not directly visualise the coronary arteries so it would not be appropriate in this case. It may be used in conjunction with other tests if there are signs of heart failure or valvular heart disease.\n\nNuclear perfusion stress test involves injecting a radioactive tracer and then imaging the heart under stress and at rest. While this test can identify areas of myocardium that are under-perfused due to significant stenosis, it exposes patients to radiation, is more expensive than CT angiography and does not directly image the coronaries. Hence, it is usually reserved for cases where other investigations are contraindicated or inconclusive.\n\nFinally, Diagnostic coronary angiography , while considered the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease, is invasive and carries risks such as bleeding, stroke or kidney damage from contrast dye. As per NICE guidelines, it should only be used when non-invasive tests are inconclusive or contraindicated or when immediate revascularisation is being considered.",

Mobitz type II is a high-degree atrioventricular block, this means that the pacemaker needs to sense both atrial and ventricular activity e.g. if there is a non-conducted p-wave (as in Mobitz type II) the pacemaker senses atrial activity, senses ventricular nonactivity, and subsequently stimulates a ventricular response.\n\nVVI pacemaker is incorrect. A VVI pacemaker is a single lead pacemaker that senses and paces the ventricles only.

From a pathology standpoint biopsies of vessels are very similar to giant cell and are typically not performed. There are 6 criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu.\n\nPresence of 3 of the 6 has 90% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis:\n\n- \uf0b7 1. Age onset <=40 years\n- \uf0b7 2. Claudication of the extremities\n- \uf0b7 3. Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries\n- \uf0b7 4. Difference of at least 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure between the arms\n- \uf0b7 5. Bruit over one or both subclavian arteries or the abdominal aorta\n- \uf0b7 6. Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or other causes.\n\nFibromuscular dysplasia typically affects the renal arteries leading to renal artery stenosis and hypertension, and it not accompanied by other systemic manifestations like fever and malaise. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic defect in type III collagen and can lead to aneurysms along with hyperelasticity of the skin and hypermobile joints, but other systemic manifestations are typically not present. Giant cell arteritis is most similar to Takayasu in pathology, however typically affects older patients and usually presents with headaches and tenderness over the temporal artery.

This is a classical sign seen in the digoxin effect, the ECG changes that arise with digoxin within normal therapeutic levels. It is important to note that in digoxin toxicity, the most common dysrhythmias are supraventricular tachycardia with a slow ventricular response due to blocking of the AV node.\n\nWhilst calcium channel blockers can significantly disrupt the ECG, this is associated primarily with non-dihydropyridines such as verapamil or diltiazem, rather than dihydropyridines such as amlodipine which are less cardioselective.\n\nBisoprolol can give rise to bradycardia and PR prolongation on ECG but the ST changes observed here are consistent with the digoxin effect. Therefore, bisoprolol is incorrect.\n\nCitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and therefore can result in QT prolongation. The ST changes as described here are not consistent with this syndrome and therefore this is an incorrect answer.\n\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic that can result in hypokalemia and therefore flattened and inverted T waves. The ST segment in this ECG shows the classical 'scooped' appearance and therefore is more consistent with the digoxin effect rather than hypokalemia. Furosemide is therefore incorrect.",

Although he does have a history of chronic back pain for which he takes analgesia, he is less likely to have neurogenic claudication compared to vascular claudication. An important discriminating factor between neurogenic claudication and vascular claudication is that patients with neurogenic claudication have symptoms on exertion that improve with manoeuvers such as leaning forward, and sitting down, whereas vascular claudication does not change with these manoeuvers and only improves with rest. In addition, his physical exam shows evidence of peripheral arterial disease characterised with muscle atrophy, shiny skin with hair loss and impalpable pedal pulses.

This patient has rightly already undergone an ankle brachial pressure index assessment, and the results indicate a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease.

        "reasoning": "Thiazides may cause photosensitivity\n\nThis patient has drug-induced photosensitivity, a skin reaction secondary to UV radiation causing expected burns or dermatitis in patients taking photosensitising medications. Drugs which cause phototoxicity include: antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones), NSAIDs, diuretics, sulfonylureas, antipsychotics as well as amiodarone, quinine and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical features of photosensitivity can vary according to the medication taken as well as the type of reaction. Some reactions may be phototoxic whilst others are photoallergic. A phototoxic reaction results from direct damage mediated by UV activation of the photosensitising agent. These reactions can appear within minutes to hours after exposure and appears as a sunburn reaction with reddening and swelling. Rarely, the skin may change pigmentation (e.g. blue-green discoloration seen with amiodarone). In severe reactions, blisters and vesicles may be seen. Other symptoms may include itch, as seen in this scenario. Thiazides typically cause a phototoxic reaction. In contrast, a photoallergic reaction is a cell-mediated response. These are less common and present as an eczematous, itchy skin reaction within 24-72 hours after exposure to sunlight. Unlike phototoxic reactions, photoallergic reactions are capable of spreading to areas that have not been exposed to sunlight. The treatment of drug-induced photosensitivity is to avoid the trigger, if possible. If the medication is essential to be taken then protective measures should be taken including sunscreen or protective clothing.\n\nIn toxic doses, digoxin is capable of causing side effects including arrhythmias, dizziness, yellow or green visual changes and skin reactions. However, they do not commonly cause photosensitivity. If there are any concerns regarding digoxin toxicity, a digoxin level can be taken with the therapeutic window ranging between 0.7ng/mL and 2.0ng/mL.\n\nAspirin is a common cause of acute or chronic urticaria. However, it does not cause photosensitivity.\n\nMetformin and ramipril do not commonly cause a rash or skin discolouration. In rare cases, patients may have an allergic reaction to these medications which results in the eruption of urticaria and, in extreme cases, lip and tongue swelling and airway compromise. However, they do not cause photosensitivity.",

The differential for a Marfanoid body habitus is wide and includes Marfan's syndrome and homocystinuria.\n\nHomocystinuria is correct. The patient has several clinical features associated with homocystinuria (e.g. Marfanoid body habitus, recurrent DVTs, learning disability and ectopia lentis). It is important to remember that the ectopia lentis in homocystinuria is inferonasal, in contrast to the superior-temporally dislocation associated with Marfan's syndrome.\n\nEctopia lentis syndrome is incorrect. Ectopia lentis syndrome is an inherited connective tissue condition that shares some of the features of Marfan's syndrome - particularly lens dislocation of the eye. However, patients with ectopia lentis syndrome do not have any vascular complications associated with Marfan's syndrome. Patients with ectopia lentis syndrome do not have any of the other features demonstrated in this case.\n\nEhlers danlos syndrome is incorrect. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are generally characterised by joint hypermobility, joint instability and dislocations, scoliosis, and other joint deformities. In the rarer types of EDS, there is also a weakness of specific tissues that can lead, for example, to major gum and dental disease, eye disease, cardiac valve and aortic root disorders, and life-threatening abdominal organ, uterine, or blood vessel rupture. Thrombotic complications and lens dislocation are rare in this condition making it a less likely diagnosis.\n\nMarfan's syndrome is incorrect.

        "reasoning": "Acute heart failure: echocardiography is indicated in new-onset heart failure, cardiogenic shock, suspected valvular or post-MI problems\n\nTransthoracic echocardiography is the correct answer. In this scenario, the patient developed cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia and cool skin) with a holosystolic murmur following a complicated inferior wall STEMI (as denoted by complete heart block on ECG). The differential diagnoses include acute mitral regurgitation (MR) and acute ventricular septal rupture (VSR). A holosystolic murmur heard over the left sternal edge suggests an acute VSR. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram is warranted to delineate the site and extent of the defect. This diagnostic step should be performed concurrently with medical therapy, preceding an immediate surgical consultation.\n\nCT coronary angiography is not appropriate in this context. Although CT coronary angiography can be useful for patients with suspected stable angina, in this case, where acute VSR is likely following a well-established inferior wall STEMI, echocardiography will provide rapid and precise information about the lesion that will inform surgical management decisions.\n\nCardiac MRI would not be suitable in this setting. Although it can sometimes provide superior detail compared to echocardiography, its longer scan times, limited availability, and inadequacy for haemodynamically unstable patients render it a less favourable choice for imaging in this emergency.\n\nImmediate surgical consultation plays a pivotal role in managing both acute MR and VSR; however, it should be preceded by a detailed lesion assessment using echocardiography to inform subsequent surgical intervention.\n\nRe-transfer to the catheter lab would not benefit this patient. Such a step may be considered if re-infarction is suspected. Given that the clinical picture points towards an acute VSR post-myocardial infarction, echocardiographic evaluation remains crucial for diagnosis, and coronary angiography will not diagnose such a complication.",

Patients typically have a history of chest pain and ECG findings include biphasic T waves in the anterior leads or deep symmetrical T wave inversion in leads I and aVL associated with 1mm ST elevation in the chest leads. These can be seen in this patient's ECG.\n\nBrugada syndrome is incorrect. Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited cardiovascular disease. It can be asymptomatic and lead to sudden cardiac death. ECG changes consistent with Brugada syndrome include convex STsegment elevation &gt; 2mm in at least 1 of V1-V3 that is followed by T wave inversion. A partial right bundle branch block may also be seen. Sometimes, a patient may have an appearance of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). However, following the administration of flecainide, these ST-segment changes may appear.\n\nHypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is incorrect. HOCM is an autosomal dominant inherited condition resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy with decreased cardiac compliance and ultimately decreased cardiac output. Most cases can be asymptomatic. However, symptoms include exertional dyspnoea or chest pain, syncope and sudden cardiac death. Given the family history of sudden cardiac death, HOCM is a reasonable differential. However, ECG features of HOCM include features of left ventricular hypertrophy (eg increased R wave height), deep Q waves and non-specific ST segment changes that are not seen in this patient's ECG.\n\nPosterior myocardial infarction is incorrect. A posterior myocardial infarction causes ECG findings such as a dominant R wave in V2, and horizontal ST depression and broad R waves in V1-V3. Although the patient has cardiacsounding chest pain, their ECG findings do not match those that we see here, making this answer incorrect.\n\nPulmonary embolus with right heart strain is incorrect. Classic findings of a pulmonary embolus include sinus tachycardia and the less common S1Q3T3 finding. However, in more significant disease, patients may exhibit features of right heart strain secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Right heart strain appears as ischaemic changes (including deep T wave inversion) in the right-sided leads of the heart.

        "reasoning": "This patient has presented with features in keeping with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The condition is due to a genetic defect causing a disorder of the cardiac muscle and, although patients can be asymptomatic, it is the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Patients who do present with symptoms typically experience exertional dyspnoea, angina and syncope episodes, commonly during or following exertion. ECG findings, as seen in this case, are of left ventricular hypertrophy, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion and deep Q waves. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cardiac echo and management is dependent on the extent of obstruction and patient symptoms.\n\nBrugada syndrome is another genetic cardiac disorder however unlike HOCM it results in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death however it is not always associated with exertion or exercise. There are several types of Brugada syndrome with variation seen on ECG however the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved\n\nST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3, followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as Brugada sign.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial and is characterised by progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Presentation is normal with worsening biventricular failure including peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Syncope episodes are rare and symptoms are not fluctuant, as seen in this patient. ECG abnormalities are those associated with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with conduction delays (e.g. LBBB), left axis deviation and poor R wave progression.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2 and 3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic-like symptoms.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is due to a genetic defect affecting the desmosomes of the myocardium. ARVD results in a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy mainly affecting the right ventricle leading to areas of hypokinesia and myocardium replacement with fibrofat. These changes can results in associated arrhythmias. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncope, and potentially sudden cardiac death however ECG findings are of T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3 and of right bundle branch block which are not present in this case.",

The complication tends to present more than 2 weeks after a myocardial infarction and symptoms may include chest pain or congestive heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath and fluid overload). This patient's ECG shows ST elevation in V1-V3 with QS waves and upright T waves. Persistent ST elevation after a myocardial infarction is suggestive of a left ventricular aneurysm. However, in a patient with a recent history of ischaemia, it is also important to exclude another ischaemic event. A left ventricular aneurysm is much more likely if there are absent reciprocal ST changes, dynamic ST changes and well-formed Q or QS waves.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome is an important diagnosis to consider following a myocardial infarction. However, ECG findings that are more typical of acute coronary ischaemia include new ST changes with dynamic and reciprocal changes, which are not seen here. Furthermore, the more gradual onset of symptoms is more suggestive of an alternative diagnosis such as a left ventricular aneurysm.\n\nPapillary muscle rupture is incorrect. An anterolateral myocardial infarction causes rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle, producing symptoms of mitral regurgitation. Although symptoms of congestive cardiac failure are evident in such cases, the onset of symptoms is usually more acute compared to a left ventricular aneurysm. Furthermore, it does not explain this patient's ECG changes or normal heart sounds (where a pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may be seen).\n\nPericarditis is incorrect. Unlike Dressler's syndrome, post-MI pericarditis is an acute complication within the first 48 hours. The presentation is also similar to acute pericarditis with pleuritic chest pain worse on lying flat.\n\nPulmonary embolism is incorrect. ECG findings consistent with a pulmonary embolism include sinus tachycardia, RAD, RBBB or S1Q3T3. It does not explain this patient's ST elevation.",

        "reasoning": "The ECG shows atrial fibrillation, as evidenced by the irregularly irregular rhythm and the lack of p-waves.\n\nAspirin 300mg once daily for 14 days, then apixaban for life is the correct answer. This patient has symptoms in keeping with a partial anterior circulation stroke. The CT head excludes an intracranial haemorrhage. Note, a normal scan is not sufficient to exclude a stroke, and stroke diagnosis should be based on clinical signs. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation which is the likely cause of the stroke. His CHA2 DS2 -VASc score is 3 due to age (+1) and stroke (+2). As such, he should receive two weeks of single anti-platelet treatment (aspirin 300mg once daily) as with all ischaemic strokes, followed by lifelong anticoagulation with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban, to prevent further strokes secondary to atrial fibrillation. Initiation of apixaban is delayed by two weeks post-stroke to prevent haemorrhagic transformation.\n\nApixaban for life is the incorrect answer. Therapeutic anticoagulation with a DOAC should not be initiated until after two weeks to avoid hemorrhagic transformation of an ischaemic stroke.\n\nAspirin 300mg once daily for 14 days, then clopidogrel 75mg once daily for life is the incorrect answer. This would be the correct answer if this patient did not have atrial fibrillation. Clopidogrel is insufficiently anti-thrombotic to prevent strokes secondary to atrial fibrillation and therefore a lifelong DOAC is required.\n\nClopidogrel 75mg once daily for life is the incorrect answer. A higher dose of antiplatelet is required to initially treat an ischaemic stroke (aspirin 300mg) and a DOAC is required long-term to reduce the atrial fibrillation-associated stroke risk.\n\nThrombolysis with alteplase, then apixaban for life is the incorrect answer.

The big clue here is that the patient became unresponsive when swimming which is typical of Long QT1 Syndrome.\n\nLong QT syndromes can result in sudden cardiac death when patients are exposed to an adrenergic surge which can put the patient into VF or VT.\n\nLong QT1: adrenergic surge due to intense physical activity such as swimming\n\nLong QT2: adrenergic surge due to intense emotion such as excitement or fear\n\nLong QT3: death during sleep",

        "updated_reasoning": "The differential for sudden cardiac death in a young, otherwise healthy individual includes both structural and primary electrical heart diseases. The key finding of a normal post-mortem examination makes structural abnormalities like Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD/RAVD) unlikely, as these typically have visible pathological changes.\n\nThis points towards a primary channelopathy (electrical disorder). The most critical clue is the context of the event: cardiac arrest during swimming. This is a classic trigger for Long QT1 Syndrome, where an adrenergic surge from exercise can provoke lethal arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes, degenerating into Ventricular Fibrillation.\n\n- **Long QT1 Syndrome:** Associated with adrenergic surges during exercise, particularly swimming.\n- **Long QT2 Syndrome:** Often triggered by auditory stimuli (e.g., alarm clock) or sudden emotional stress.\n- **Long QT3 Syndrome:** Events typically occur at rest or during sleep (bradycardia-dependent).\n\nGiven the presentation, Long QT1 Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",

Her past medical history includes hypertension, previous myocardial infarctions 7 months ago, chronic kidney disease and COPD. She has a 50 pack year smoking history giving up 2 years ago. Her exercise tolerance is 150 yards, limited by shortness of breath.\n\nOn examination, an ejection systolic murmur can be heard in the aortic area with bibasal crackles on chest auscultation. An admission chest x-ray is consistent with pulmonary oedema and intravenous diuresis is commenced. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrates ejection fraction of 33% with impaired left ventricular function, no vegetations, a bicuspid heavily calcified aortic valve with an area of 0.7cm2 and a peak gradient of 32mmHg. Angiography demonstrates non-flow limiting stenosis of 65% in the left anterior descending artery but no lesions requiring revascularisation.

        "reasoning": "The patient has presented with pulmonary oedema on a background of severe aortic stenosis, secondary to calcifications and a bicuspid valve. Interestingly, this is a patient who presents with low-gradient low-area aortic stenosis not uncommonly encountered in more elderly patients. In the context of poor LV function, the aortic valve gradient may be normal or only mildly raised in the presence of a severely narrowed aortic valve area.\n\nA second consideration is the suitability of this patient for surgery. She has underlying lung disease secondary to COPD and functional impairment on pulmonary testing, renal impairment and recent myocardial infarction. She is a high-risk surgical candidate and unlikely suitable for aortic valve replacement. Inaction is not an option, the patient has presented with pulmonary oedema and underlying exercise-induced dyspnoea. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty is a palliative procedure prone to restenosis for patients unsuitable for other interventions. She does not require a CABG for her coronary artery disease, which worryingly seems inconsistent with the degree of left ventricular impairment, suggesting aortic stenosis to likely be responsible for the majority of symptoms. A transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) is the appropriate management in this situation. The catheter-delivered device produces similar one-year survival as aortic valve replacement but a higher risk of stroke, TIAs and vascular complications. Compared to medical management alone, one-year survival is reduced with TAVI from 50.7% to 30.7% 1 .",

Diagnostic findings include an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm\u00b2, a low peak gradient of 32 mmHg, and a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. This clinical picture is characteristic of low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis in a high-risk patient.",
        "updated_reasoning": "The patient has symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (valve area <1.0 cm\u00b2 with heart failure symptoms), which requires definitive intervention. \n\n*   **Surgical Risk:** The patient is a high-risk candidate for traditional open-heart surgery (Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement - SAVR) due to advanced age, severe COPD, chronic kidney disease, and poor LV function. Therefore, options (c) and (e) are inappropriate.\n*   **Coronary Disease:** Angiography revealed non-flow limiting coronary artery disease, meaning coronary revascularization (CABG) is not indicated. This further rules out option (e).\n*   **Medical Management vs. Palliative Care:** Given her severe symptoms (pulmonary edema), inaction (a) is not appropriate. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (b) is considered a palliative or bridging procedure with high rates of restenosis and is not a definitive treatment.\n*   **Optimal Intervention:** Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the recommended treatment for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high or prohibitive risk for conventional surgery.
