It can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.\n\nAdd in sitagliptin is incorrect. Sitagliptin is a DDP-4 inhibitor and can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.\n\nReduce metformin dose is incorrect, the current metformin dose is maintaining a good HbA1c and the patient is not troubled by hypo or hyperglycaemia. There would be no indication to reduce the dose in this case.\n\nNo changes to current medications would be appropriate if this patient had not developed atrial fibrillation. Due to the development of atrial fibrillation, his cardiovascular risk is much increased and as a result, the current best practice is to add in an SGLT-2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin.",

Patients often present with primary amenorrhoea along with absent pubic/axillary hair.

This is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that may also present with primary amenorrhoea and external female genitalia. However, in this condition, testosterone will be low as a lack of androgens are characteristic of this disease.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is incorrect. This is a syndrome where a patient that is phenotypically male has an extra X chromosome (i.e. 47 XXY). Patients may have small testicles and infertility as predominant features. The patient in this scenario is phenotypically female.\n\nPituitary tumour is incorrect. This may cause delayed puberty if it causes impaired secretion of gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) i.e. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, breast development may also be impaired with a pituitary tumour and testosterone will be in the normal range for a female, in contrast to this case where it is in the high-normal range for a male.\n\nTurner syndrome is incorrect. This can cause primary amenorrhoea as a consequence of primary ovarian insufficiency. Breast development will be abnormal but pubic and axillary hair development will typically be normal.

Without insulin, the body cannot use glucose for energy and therefore fat sources are broken down to use as fuel, prompting the generation of ketones, which in turn cause acidosis. To reverse this process and resolve ketonemia and acidosis, we need to continue insulin. Insulin therapy causes a lowering of blood glucose levels and therefore we should administer IV dextrose alongside insulin in order to prevent hypoglycaemia while allowing continued insulin administration.\n\nNo changes to current management is incorrect. Insulin drives glucose into cells and lowers blood glucose levels. We need to continue insulin until the ketonemia has resolved. However, this will cause hypoglycaemia unless we add IV dextrose.\n\nStop FRII and continue 0.9% sodium chloride with added potassium is incorrect. While this will result in the resolution of dehydration and avoid precipitating hypoglycaemia (as insulin has been stopped), it will not correct the underlying pathophysiological process (insulin deficiency) and the DKA will worsen.\n\nStop current management and switch to IV dextrose is not the right answer. Stopping insulin will resulting in worsening DKA, compounded by exogenous glucose administration.\n\nSwitch to VRII, continue current IV fluids and add IV dextrose is incorrect.

This is because, in FHH, loss of function mutations in the CASR calcium-sensing receptor decrease sensitivity to calcium, meaning PTH remains unsuppressed at higher-than-normal serum calcium levels.

Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of monogenic disorders characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually before 25 years of age), and a primary defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. A family history of early onset diabetes mellitus is most suggestive of MODY because it indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition to the condition, which is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern seen in MODY.\n\nKetosis during periods of hyperglycaemia is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes rather than MODY. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to an absolute insulin deficiency. In the absence of sufficient insulin, the body relies on breaking down fats for energy, resulting in ketone production and ketosis. In contrast, patients with MODY typically have a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function but still produce some insulin, so they are less likely to develop ketosis.\n\nA history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is not particularly suggestive of MODY. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some forms of MODY can be associated with insulin resistance, it would not be considered the most characteristic feature when trying to differentiate between types of diabetes.\n\nLack of response to sulphonylureas can be seen in some subtypes of MODY (e.g., MODY 1 and MODY 3). However, it does not necessarily rule out other types or subtypes since there are several different genetic defects that can cause MODY. Furthermore, lack of response to sulphonylureas could also occur in type 2 diabetics who have progressed to needing insulin therapy.\n\nA history of autoimmune disease is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes, as it results from an autoimmune process that destroys pancreatic beta cells.

        "reasoning": "The syndrome presented here is that of Gitelman syndrome . This is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule. Symptomatic patients present with symptoms identical to those taking excessive thiazide diuretics - hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hyponatraemia. Patients are normotensive. Importantly, patients also display hypocalciuria, which differentiates the condition from Bartter syndrome. Treatment involves salt replacement.\n\nBartter syndrome is a similar condition, except that it involves a mutation in the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in the loop of Henle. As such, the condition mimics loop diuretic abuse. Whilst also presenting with hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and normotension, the condition crucially presents with hypercalciuria, rather than hypocalciuria as seen in Gitelman syndrome.\n\nDent disease is a rare X-linked recessive condition that affects the proximal tubules. It is characterised by tubular proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and glycosuria. It is one of the causes of Fanconi syndrome. The scenario above is more closely aligned with Gitelman syndrome.\n\nFanconi syndrome is a syndrome of proximal tubule dysfunction. It presents with polyuria and polydipsia, like in this scenario, but patients would also have proteinuria and glycosuria, unlike the patient here. Hypokalaemia would also be noted, as well as hypophosphataemia. It may be genetic, such as being caused by Dent disease or acquired.\n\nLiddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition - a mutation in the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) of the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The condition causes hypertension, which does not respond to medications, and hypokalaemia. Typically, children are asymptomatic at presentation. The patient in this scenario is normotensive",

A low IGF-1 in such a clinical context may point towards GHD, which needs to be confirmed with dynamic tests for GH secretion. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the gold standard for assessing GH secretion, although it needs to be conducted carefully in a closely-monitored space due to the risks associated with hypoglycaemia. ITT is contra-indicated in patients with seizures or ischaemic heart disease. As a result, an alternative test such as arginine-GHRH stimulation test is employed (as in this clinical scenario where the patient has IHD). About 30-40% of patients with GHD may have a normal IGF-1 level. IGF-1 levels are influenced by age, time of onset of GHD, and degree of hypopituitarism.

Calcium homeostasis is a complicated process involving PTH, vitamin D, albumin and numerous electrolytes. Acquired hypoparathyroidism is the most common form of true hypocalcaemia, most often occurring transiently after thyroid surgery or after the removal of a parathyroid adenoma. Occasionally, hypomagnesaemia can produce hypocalcaemia by decreasing both the body's production of PTH and its sensitivity to the hormone. In this case, it is likely that the patient became magnesium depleted from her course of watery diarrhoea, likely baseline poor nutritional status and alcohol abuse.\n\nChoice 1: Hyperuricaemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Chronic kidney disease, however, can lead to hypocalcaemia in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but there is no evidence of renal failure in this patient.\n\nChoice 2: Fluid balance (hyper- or hyponatraemia) does not play a role in calcium homeostasis.\n\nChoice 4: Hypophosphataemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Actually, hypocalcaemia often leads to hyperphosphataemia secondary to increased PTHmediated bone resorption.

Though the details of this are obscured in the question, it is likely that removal of a pituitary mass with trans-sphenoidal surgery. This is exhibited by fairly non-descript symptoms coupled with some underlying evidence of lack of anterior pituitary hormones: low BP/dizziness/postural hypotension, high/normal K+, low/normal Na+ and low/normal blood glucose all indicate lack of cortisol due to low ACTH; the low/normal temperature and heart rate and the tiredness steer you towards low thyroxine level due to lack of TSH.\n\nThis gentleman needs assessment of his pituitary function. This can be done in many ways. A baseline pituitary hormone profile can be quite useful; however the most definitive tests involve assessing dynamic pituitary function. The insulin stress test (coupled with TRH and GnRH tests) creates a hypoglycaemic effect in the body and the response of the pituitary (cortisol surge) is measured. However, inducing hypoglycaemia in epileptics, such as this gentleman, is contraindicated. Therefore the next best investigation is the glucagon stimulation test which mimics hypoglycaemia in the body and causes a fake stress on the pituitary, therefore being safe to use in epileptics.",

The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterised by metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia, and ketonaemia. Management involves intravenous normal saline for rehydration, insulin therapy at a rate of 6.3 units/h (based on the patient's body weight of 63 kg), and potassium replacement at 40 mmol/L because the patient's serum potassium is within the range of 3.5-5.5 mmol/L.\n\nIV normal saline, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L potassium are incorrect because the appropriate insulin infusion rate should be calculated as 0.1 unit/kg/hour; for a patient weighing 63 kg, this equates to an infusion rate of 6.3 units/hour.\n\n## IV normal saline, 63 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L\npotassium represents a significant overdose of insulin.

Moreover, leukocytosis can occur associated with hyperglycaemia and DKA; thus, it should not automatically prompt antibiotic administration without further evidence suggestive of infection.\n\nIV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is incorrect due to the unnecessary inclusion of antibiotics in the treatment regimen.

        "reasoning": "Women with hypothyroidism may need to increase their thyroid hormone replacement dose by up to 50% as early as 4-6 weeks of pregnancy\n\nDuring pregnancy, the thyroid gland increases in size by 10% and the production of thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, increases by 50%.\n\nIf a patient has pre-existing hypothyroidism, we usually need to increase the dose of levothyroxine to mimic these changes.\n\nIncrease levothyroxine dose to 150 micrograms daily : an increase of levothyroxine supplementation of up to 50% mimics the physiological thyroid response to pregnancy and is the correct option for this patient.\n\nContinue on current levothyroxine dose, no further monitoring required during pregnancy : this is incorrect. The requirement for T3 and T4 increases during pregnancy, therefore the levothyroxine dose must be increased.\n\nIncrease levothyroxine dose to 200 micrograms once daily immediately : this increase is too high, the patient does not require such an aggressive dosage adjustment.\n\nReduce levothyroxine dose to 75 micrograms once daily : incorrect, levothyroxine dose should not routinely be reduced during pregnancy, the requirement generally increases.\n\nRepeat thyroid function tests at 12 weeks gestation and then consider adjusting levothyroxine dose : this would be inappropriate, thyroid abnormalities should be treated as soon as possible to minimise the risk to the foetus. Ideally, the patient should be counselled before conception. Maternal hypothyroidism is associated with low birth weight, premature labour, and neonatal respiratory problems.",

        "reasoning": "Pregnant with hypothyroidism \u2192 immediately increase levothyroxine and monitor TSH closely\n\nThe correct answer is to increase levothyroxine to 100mcg od . In pregnant women with hypothyroidism, it is essential to maintain adequate thyroid hormone levels for the developing fetus. The requirement for levothyroxine often increases during pregnancy due to increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and placental degradation of maternal T4. According to UK guidelines, pregnant women with pre-existing hypothyroidism should have their levothyroxine dose increased by approximately 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, even before obtaining repeat TSH and free T4 measurements. This ensures that both mother and baby have sufficient thyroid hormone levels during the critical early stages of fetal development.\n\nThe option to decrease levothyroxine to 50mcg od would not be appropriate, as reducing the dose could lead to inadequate thyroid hormone levels in the mother and potentially harm fetal development.\n\nKeeping the levothyroxine at 75mcg od might seem reasonable if her TSH was well-controlled prior to pregnancy; however, this does not account for the increased requirements during pregnancy. It would be safer and more appropriate to increase the dose proactively.\n\nAs for keeping levothyroxine at 75mcg od + increasing folic acid to 5mg od , while it is important for pregnant women to take folic acid supplements, increasing the dose of folic acid alone without adjusting the levothyroxine dosage does not address her increased thyroid hormone needs during pregnancy.\n\nFinally, choosing to stop levothyroxine until TSH is known would put both mother and fetus at risk of complications related to untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism. It is crucial that patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism continue their levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy, with appropriate dose adjustments as needed.",

Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The biochemical profile is in keeping with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to the presence of low testosterone and inappropriately normal LH and FSH. Kallmann's syndrome is the only listed condition which results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is correct. Androgen insensitivity syndrome in its complete form is a disorder of hormone resistance characterised by a female phenotype in a genetic male due to the resistance to the effector functions of testosterone. The hormonal profile findings include very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH. Thus the patient's phenotypical sex and hormonal profile exclude this diagnosis.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is incorrect. Klinefelter syndrome is an aneuploid genetic condition where a male has an additional copy of the X chromosome. The primary features are infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles. This condition results in primary gonadal failure, and thus a compensatory elevation in LH and FSH.\n\nMullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Given that the patient is phenotypically male, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\nTurner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. This would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels. It only affects females.

The history of immigration is important as it raises the possibility of missed childhood diagnoses, in this case implying a missed chromosomal disorder.

        "reasoning": "Hypernatraemia associated with hypervolaemia can occur due to hypertonic saline, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, excess salt in diet, or hyperaldosteronism\n\nLiddle syndrome is the correct option. This rare autosomal dominant syndrome is due to dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus, leading to the Na channel not being degraded, thus leading to chronic reabsorption of sodium and water in the nephron. This mimics a state of hyperaldosteronism as aldosterone is usually the hormone implicated in inserting the ENaCs into the nephron. Therefore, this patient has a state of hypervolaemic hypernatraemia with chronically high blood pressure creating the end-organ damage to the optic nerve and heart described above.\n\nThe feedback loop in the kidneys has meant that both renin and aldosterone are low for her body to attempt to lower the sodium and water retention. This patient is fatigued and constipated due to hypokalaemia. Liddle's is treated with a combination of a low sodium diet and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride).\n\nLiddle's has a classic triad in the textbooks of hypertension, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. However, hypernatraemia is also a feature due to the above processes and this should not be forgotten in the clinical work-up.\n\nBartter's syndrome is an incorrect option. This is an autosomal recessive syndrome which causes salt-wasting from the kidney and subsequently a state of hyperaldosteronism and usually low blood pressure, not high blood pressure as seen in this case.\n\nGitelman's syndrome is an incorrect option as it is another autosomal recessive syndrome similar to Bartter's, which causes low blood pressure usually.\n\nExcess salt in the diet is incorrect. Even though it would cause hypernatraemia and chronic excess would cause states of hypertension; you would not find hypokalaemia. Furthermore, it would be a more unlikely cause at the young age of this patient with the anti-hypertensive therapy resistance.\n\nRenal artery stenosis is an incorrect answer because this condition causes difficulty to control hypertension with a high plasma renin activity found, instead of low, as more renin is produced in response to the low pressure sensed by the constricted renal artery. The kidneys think that the blood pressure is systemically low when it is a locally mediated effect from the stenosis.",

De Quervains thyroiditis can present with symptoms similar to factitious thyroiditis and a decreased uptake on radioisotope scan, however, the fact the symptom shave lasted for 7 months makes this diagnosis unlikely.",

        "reasoning": "The long Synacthen test can be used to distinguish primary adrenal failure from secondary adrenal failure\n\nThe diagnosis here is that of adrenal insufficiency. The history of fatigue, anorexia and nausea points towards this, along with evidence of hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, hypotension, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. A primary failure is known as Addison's disease. To make the initial diagnosis of adrenal failure, a short Synacthen test should be used - cortisol will fail to rise. However, the question is asking specifically how to differentiate primary from secondary adrenal failure, secondary being a failure of the pituitary to make sufficient ACTH. For this, the long Synacthen test should be used - a higher dose is given and then cortisol levels measured over a longer time period. With primary failure, the adrenals will still be unable to produce cortisol, but with secondary failure, the exogenous ACTH will eventually push the adrenals to produce cortisol.\n\nThe high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate primary and secondary causes of Cushing's syndrome, not adrenal insufficiency. This would have instead presented with weight gain and hypokalemia, not the other way around.\n\nThe low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used first-line to make the initial diagnosis of Cushing's. It does not play a role here.\n\nThe short Synacthen test is used to initially diagnose adrenal insufficiency. It does not, however, differentiate between primary and secondary causes - the long test does this.\n\nUrinary metanephrines are used to diagnose pheochromocytoma. In this condition, there is increased secretion of catecholamines and patients present with hypertension, headaches, sweating and palpitations.",

These mutations are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The presentation is often incidental, with recurrent hyperglycaemia without ketosis.\n\nLow dose gliclazide is the correct answer. HNF1A mutations lead to a reduction in the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas.\n\nMetformin is incorrect. The main mechanism of action of metformin is increased sensitivity to insulin. Gliclazide is the preferred treatment as the HNF1A mutation reduces insulin production by the pancreas. It responds better to insulin secretagogue treatment than an insulin-sensitising agent.\n\nInsulin is incorrect. Most patients with MODY do not require insulin as there is generally some insulin secretion from the pancreas particularly in early diagnosis. Treatment with a secretagogue such as gliclazide is therefore preferable.\n\nNo treatment required is incorrect. All forms of MODY apart from glucokinase MODY increase the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. Treatment to stabilise and control blood glucose levels is therefore advisable.\n\nDietary advice and lifestyle changes is an incorrect answer. Although this advice would form part of the management, the main treatment would be pharmacological with a low dose of gliclazide. Unlike in early type-2 diabetes or pre-diabetes where there is a possibility of improving insulin sensitivity by decreasing glucose spikes, MODY is not reversible.",

ALP is found in bone, liver, kidney, and intestinal and placental tissue, so ALP tends to rise during pregnancy. In pregnant women levels of up to twice that upper limit can still be normal.\n\nAcute cholecystitis would usually present with abdominal symptoms and right upper quadrant tenderness. It is important to bear in mind that the risk of gallstones increases during pregnancy, as oestrogen can lead to higher cholesterol levels in bile.\n\nDiagnosis (according to NICE) can be made based on either a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L or above, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or above. Her fasting plasma glucose is below the threshold.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with itching (particularly in palms and soles) and can lead to complications for both mother and baby if untreated. LFTs are usually deranged but may be normal on some occasions.\n\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is excessive fat build-up in the liver without another clear cause. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated liver enzymes are common in both but would not typically present with just an isolated rise in ALP.

Although often associated with pelvic floor damage for example during childbirth, it can also present as a result of age-related changes. The first-line management for stress incontinence is pelvic floor muscle training which is the correct answer here.\n\nBladder retraining is useful in cases of urge incontinence however this patient denies any history of urinary urgency. Urge incontinence occurs due to an overactive bladder. Bladder retraining aims to regain control over the function of the bladder. As stress incontinence is related to weakened pelvic floor muscles, bladder retraining would not be as effective as pelvic floor muscle training in this case.\n\nMirabegron is a beta-3 agonist that relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder, increasing bladder capacity. As the primary problem with stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, mirabegron would not be the first-line treatment in this case.\n\nOxybutynin is an antimuscarinic that is also prescribed for an overactive bladder. Again, this relaxes the detrusor muscles but as the primary pathology in stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, this would not be the first-line management step here.\n\nTamsulosin is an alpha-1 antagonist which relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and urethra. This is useful in the treatment of overflow incontinence as a result of urethral obstruction for example from benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has no effect on the pelvic floor muscles which are weakened in stress incontinence and so has no role here.",

        "reasoning": "In thyroid storm, treat acutely with propylthiouracil rather than carbimazole or surgery\n\nThe stem describes a classic case of thyroid storm. It is most commonly seen in patients with a background of Grave's disease but can occur in other scenarios too. There is usually a precipitating insult such as diabetic ketoacidosis or a heart attack.\n\nThe likelihood of a thyroid storm can be calculated using the Burch and Wartofksy thyroid storm diagnostic criteria. This attributes points to the presence of pyrexia, tachycardia, signs of heart failure, confusion, coma, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbance etc.\n\nIn this case, the patient scores 90. A score of >45 indicates a likely thyroid storm. The patient also has a suppressed TSH level with raised T4, this cements the diagnosis.\n\nIn an ideal situation treatment for presumed thyroid storm should not be delayed whilst awaiting blood results as this condition has significant mortality (>10%). Blood tests may be in keeping with hyperthyroidism, but there is no specific cut- off to diagnose thyroid storm, the diagnosis is made on clinical findings.\n\nPropylthiouracil is the correct answer. Patients should be assessed with an ABCDE approach and stabilised. IV fluids and cooling are important aspects of treatment. Tachyarrhythmias should also be managed according to local guidelines. The most appropriate treatment for the underlying thyroid storm is propylthiouracil. This inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and also inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3.\n\nCarbimazole is incorrect. Although carbimazole can be used, propylthiouracil is the traditionally preferred treatment as it has a faster onset of action and also inhibits the conversion of fT4 to T3.\n\nThyroidectomy is incorrect. This can be used as a definitive treatment for Grave's disease and can also be used in the acute setting if a patient has had a previous poor reaction to thionamides such as propylthiouracil. Usually, the first-line treatment would be stabilisation with beta-blockers, supportive treatment and oral thionamides.\n\nIV antibiotics is incorrect. In this case, the patient is pyrexial and has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain could indicate an intra-abdominal infection. It would not be unusual for the patient to receive IV antibiotics in this scenario to cover for potential infection, but given the blood results here - normal white cell count, normal CRP, and deranged thyroid function - we can be quite sure of a diagnosis of thyroid storm which wouldn't respond to IV antibiotics. The concomitant atrial fibrillation with signs of heart failure (pedal oedema), extreme pyrexia, and delirium, are better explained by thyroid storm.\n\n300mg aspirin is incorrect. This would be the treatment of stroke. There is an altered conscious level with behavioural changes and pyrexia, both of which can be seen in acute stroke. There are, however, no focal neurological findings described and a stroke would not explain the change in bowel habit and abdominal pain.",

This results in a raised osmolar gap\n\nIdentifying the cause of hyponatraemia can be challenging. The first step is to confirm that it is a true hypotonic hyponatraemia. This is done by measuring the plasma osmolarity.\n\n- If the measured plasma osmolarity is low this confirms true hypotonic hyponatraemia.\n- If the plasma osmolarity is normal then this is suggestive of pseudohyponatraemia and should prompt you to measure proteins and lipids, which if present in high levels, can cause a pseudohyponatraemia due to the measuring technique.\n- If the serum osmolarity is high then this confirms hypertonic hyponatraemia and should prompt you to check for high levels of solutes in the plasma, hyperglycaemia being the most common.\n\nIn this case, the normal measured serum osmolarity suggests pseudohyponatraemia. Pseudohyponatraemia occurs due to a measuring technique defect. Using standard techniques, serum sodium is measured as a ratio of sodium to plasma volume. If the patients plasma has high amounts of proteins or lipids, the plasma volume will be increased resulting in a measured hyponatraemia. This is not a true hyponatraemia as the actual ratio of sodium to plasma fluid will be normal. Common causes include hyperproteinaemia (e.g. TPN, IVIG) and hyperlipidaemia (in particular hypertriglyceridemia).\n\nIn this case, the measured serum osmolarity can be compared with the calculated serum osmolarity. The calculated serum osmolarity = 2Na + 2K + glucose + urea = 273.3 mOsmol/kg. The osmolar gap = measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity = 290 - 273.3 = 16.7 (normal <10). A raised osmolar gap is suggestive of the presence of other osmotically active particles. In this case it is due to the presence of a significantly raised triglyceride level.",

        "reasoning": "The diagnosis in this scenario is non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia which manifests in adolescence/adulthood. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21 hydroxylase in the steroid biosynthetic pathway. The result is a shift in the production of steroid hormones towards the androgenic pathway. Since cortisol secretion is reduced, feedback leads to increased ACTH production and resultant hyperplasia of the adrenals. The level of the compounds that are formed prior to the action of 21 hydroxylase is increased, therefore levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone are elevated. Due to excessive androgen production, there is virilization and hirsutism.\n\nTreatment involves steroids given in reverse circadian rhythm, i.e. a higher dosage at night and a lower dose in the morning.\n\nThe rationale behind this approach is due to the pathophysiology of CAH.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of acromegaly, which is caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland. Acromegaly can lead to hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and other complications. Serum IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) levels are a reliable indicator of GH activity and are more stable than serum GH levels throughout the day. An elevated serum IGF-1 level would support the diagnosis of acromegaly.\n\nSerum growth hormone measurement is not the best first-line investigation because GH secretion is pulsatile, with peaks and troughs throughout the day. This can lead to false-negative results if the blood sample is taken during a period when GH levels are low. Serum IGF-1 levels are less variable and provide a more accurate assessment of overall GH activity.\n\nVisual field testing could be useful in assessing potential compression of the optic chiasm by a pituitary tumour causing acromegaly; however, it is not an appropriate first-line diagnostic test for confirming the presence of acromegaly itself. It would be more relevant once biochemical evidence has been obtained to support the diagnosis.\n\nAn oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum glucose may be helpful in evaluating a patient's diabetes status but does not directly address the suspicion of acromegaly. In patients with confirmed acromegaly, an oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone may be used to assess disease activity, as normal individuals should have suppressed GH levels after glucose ingestion, while those with acromegaly will not suppress their GH adequately.\n\nA pituitary MRI could potentially identify a pituitary adenoma as the cause of acromegaly; however, it is not the best first-line investigation. Biochemical confirmation of GH excess should be obtained before performing imaging studies.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of acromegaly has been established through elevated serum IGF-1 levels and/or an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone, a pituitary MRI would then be appropriate to identify the underlying cause and guide further management.",

Since his MRI showed a pituitary adenoma, he was treated with transsphenoidal surgery. However, he remains symptomatic, and his IGF-1 levels have not reduced even after 3 months. Patients with residual symptoms need to repeat transsphenoidal surgery or start medical therapy with octreotide.\n\nSince this patient has no residual tumour on his repeat MRI, he is not a candidate for repeat transsphenoidal surgery. Therefore, the most appropriate step for this patient is to start medical therapy with octreotide. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. It tends to decrease the size of the adenoma and its secretion of growth hormone.\n\nStereotactic radiotherapy is recommended for patients who fail medical therapy and is therefore not the best next step in the management of this patient.\n\nRepeating IGF-1 levels again in 12 weeks is inappropriate as the IGF-1 level should have normalised at this follow-up 12 weeks after the transsphenoidal surgery. His repeat IGF-1 levels at 12 weeks are raised. He requires further medical or surgical management instead of follow-up in 12 weeks.\n\nPatients with normal IGF-1 levels on a 12-week follow-up should have repeat IGF-1 levels at six months and then, annually.",

The most appropriate investigation to differentiate between the two is supervised fasting with monitoring of blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide can demonstrate or exclude insulinoma. If the patient were to have an insulinoma, then during fasting the blood glucose would become low, with elevated serum insulin and C-peptide, as C-peptide corresponds to endogenous rather than exogenous insulin.

        "reasoning": "Type 1 ( distal ) renal tubular acidosis may be caused by Sjogren's syndrome. This patient has features consistent with Sjogren's syndrome. The xerostomia (dry mouth) can lead to difficulty swallowing, particularly foods needing more saliva. The other characteristic feature is xerophthalmia (dry eyes) which can make the eyes feel gritty and uncomfortable. Sjogren's syndrome is associated with type 1 renal tubular acidosis. Type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis occurs due to an inability to excrete H+ in the distal tubule. The resulting acidosis is usually accompanied by hypokalaemia. Complications include nephrocalcinosis and renal stones. Causes include idiopathic, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjogren's, amphotericin B toxicity, and analgesic nephropathy. A sometimes helpful reminder is that type 1 renal tubular acidosis is largely associated with structural/rheumatological problems, whereas, type 2 renal tubular acidosis is associated with metabolic disorders such as Fanconi syndrome, Wilson's disease, and cystinosis. Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypoaldosteronism and diabetes, rather than Sjogren's. Type 4 is associated with hyperkalaemia, whilst types 1 and 2 are associated with hypokalaemia. Sjogren's is typically associated with elevated levels of anti-Ro and anti-La. Neither cANCA nor pANCA are typically associated. ANCA antibodies are commonly associated with vasculitides. cANCA (cytoplasmic-ANCA) is associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. pANCA is found in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",

        "reasoning": "The correct answer is type 2 renal tubular acidosis . This patient has metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia, proteinuria and glycosuria. The presence of proteinuria and glycosuria suggest a problem at the proximal convoluted tubule, as protein and glucose should be fully reabsorbed at this part of the nephron. Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is a consequence of a defect of the proximal tubular cells, leading to incomplete protein and glucose reabsorption, as well as defective bicarbonate reabsorption leading to acidosis. This is the most likely diagnosis in this patient and has likely been precipitated by the drug topiramate.\nMembranous glomerulonephritis is incorrect. To diagnose membranous glomerulonephritis, one would expect to see nephrotic range proteinuria (&gt;3g per 24h), and ideally, histological confirmation on renal biopsy. Membranous glomerulonephritis is more associated with NSAIDs and penicillamine than topiramate and is unlikely to cause metabolic acidosis in the context of the normal renal function seen here.\nType 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although this can cause hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis, the distal tubular cells are affected rather than the cells of the proximal tubule. This means there is less of an association with proteinuria and glycosuria. Finally, topiramate is not known to precipitate type 1 renal tubular acidosis.\nType 3 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This tends to be seen in children or as a result of congenital carbonic anhydrase deficiency. It is epidemiologically far rarer than type 2 renal tubular acidosis and is not specifically associated with topiramate use.\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect.

A low potassium level would make the diagnosis here clearer. Average potassium levels in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are around 2.4mmol/L.
