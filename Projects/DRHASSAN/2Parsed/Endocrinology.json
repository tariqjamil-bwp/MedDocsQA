She has a CT of the abdomen with contrast, which confirms diverticulitis. This responds well to treatment, and she is discharged.\n\nThe patient is readmitted three weeks later in fast atrial fibrillation. On assessment, she reports a one-week history of palpitations, non-bloody diarrhoea and feeling hot all the time. She continues to smoke 5 cigarettes per day and denies recent coryzal symptoms.\n\nOn examination, she has an irregular pulse of 134 bpm and a BP of 132/88 mmHg. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with active bowel sounds. A non-tender goitre is present.\n\nHer investigations:\n\n| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | < 0.05 mU/L   | (0.5-5.5)   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 24 pmol/L     | (9.0 - 18)  |\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of her presentation?\n\n- a) Administration of contrast\n- b) De Quervain's thyroiditis\n- c) Further episode of diverticulitis\n- d) Riedel's thyroiditis\n- e) Smoking\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nThyrotoxicosis may develop in patients following the administration of contrast, particularly if a background of thyroid disease\n\nAdministration of contrast is the correct answer here. This can precipitate thyrotoxicosis in patients with a history of previous thyroid disease. IV contrast results in a load of iodine to the thyroid, resulting in increased secretion of thyroid hormones and hyperthyroidism, which can develop over 2-12 weeks.\n\nDe Quervain's thyroiditis often follows an upper respiratory viral illness and usually presents with a painful goitre. In this case, the patient denies coryzal symptoms and has a non-tender goitre, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\nThough a further episode of diverticulitis is possible, the vignette suggests a clinical resolution, and this diagnosis would be unlikely with a soft, non-tender abdomen.\n\nPatients with Riedel's thyroiditis classically present with clinical and biochemical features consistent with hypothyroidism, which is not the case here.\n\nWhile the patient has a history of smoking , her intake has not drastically increased. Furthermore, smoking induces mild hyperthyroidism, so this is unlikely to be the cause of her presentation in this case."

This is a patient with new type two diabetes and initial treatment would normally be metformin, but since the eGFR is &lt;30ml/minute/1.73m2 metformin is contraindicated. The next step would be either a a dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. However, pioglitazone should not be offered to a patient with a history of bladder cancer. Therefore that leaves sulfonylurea as the correct answer. Insulin and GLP-1 mimetic could be used further down in the treatment algorithm."

She is otherwise fit and well, enjoying running recreationally and eating healthy. She does not drink, smoke or use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are normal and body mass index is 22 kg/m\u00b2.\n\nPhysical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine pregnancy test is negative.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate screening test for this patient?\n\n- a) Karyotype\n- b) MRI of the pituitary\n- c) Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone\n- d) Serum prolactin\n- e) Ultrasound of the pelvis\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThe patients presentation is consistent with secondary amenorrhoea. The first investigative step is normally to do a pregnancy test, which in this case is negative. There are no obvious explanations for secondary amenorrhoea from her presentation. Hence the next step is to obtain serum prolactin, TSH and FSH blood results (as this will help differentiate between the most common causes of secondary amenorrhoea following pregnancy: hyperprolactinaemia, thyroid dysfunction and premature ovarian failure respectively).\n\nChoice 1: Premature ovarian insufficiency is characterised by elevated FSH and low oestradiol. A karyotype may be considered if Turner syndrome or fragile X syndrome is suspected, as these patients usually have ovarian dysfunction. However, this patient has no dysmorphic features or other co-morbidities to warrant karyotype evaluation.\n\nChoice 2: An MRI of the pituitary should be performed in patients with persistently elevated prolactin (with or without galactorrhoea), unexplained headaches, bitemporal hemianopia or other concerning neurologic findings. It is not an appropriate screening test in this patient.\n\nChoice 3: Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated in non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a condition that presents with hyperandrogenism in late childhood. This patient has no findings of androgen excess (e.g. male pattern hair distribution, severe acne).\n\nChoice 5: An ultrasound may be indicated in patients with abnormal pelvic pain, pelvic organ enlargement or masses on examination, or signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g. polycystic ovarian syndrome, androgen tumour), none of which are seen in this patient."

She is not currently on any regular medications. On examination, there was evidence of hirsutism and acne, a cervical fat pad, striae on her abdomen and proximal myopathy.

The diagnosis of a secreting pituitary tumour causing a raised level of prolactin and ACTH (causing hyperpigmentation) and hence, cortisol, should be suspected.\n\nLow dose dexamethasone suppression test and 24-hour urinary cortisol will aid confirming the presence of Cushing's syndrome.

A chest x-ray demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia and ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response. Initial management included intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids and oral digoxin loading.\n\nTwo days after admission, the patient's condition had significantly improved and she was able to start mobilising on the ward. The palpitations that she had been experiencing at presentation had also ceased. Following review by the Senior House Officer on the ward round, a repeat ECG was requested when demonstrated that the patient had cardioverted back to sinus rhythm. Digoxin therapy was subsequently held.\n\nTo investigate for an underlying cause of atrial fibrillation, thyroid function tests were added to blood tests from admission, with results as listed below.\n\n| Haemoglobin                 | 125 g / dL       |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| White cell count            | 13.7* 10 9 /l    |\n| Neutrophils                 | 11.9* 10 9 /l    |\n| Platelets                   | 351 * 10 9 /l    |\n| Urea                        | 4.6 mmol / L     |\n| Creatinine                  | 130 micromol / L |\n| Sodium                      | 139 mmol / L     |\n| Potassium                   | 3.6 mmol / L     |\n| C-reactive protein          | 105 mg / L       |\n| Thyroid stimulating hormone | 0.25 microU / L  |\n| T4 free serum               | 14.1 pmol / L    |\n| T3 free serum               | 7.4 pmol / L     |\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next investigation to assess deranged thyroid function tests?\n\n- a) Thyroid ultrasound\n- b) Thyroid peroxidase antibody levels\n- c) Repeat TFT in 6 weeks\n- d) Thyroid scintiscanning\n- e) Thyroglobulin antibody levels\n\nCorrect answer is .c\n\nSick euthyroid is common in unwell, elderly patients and often needs no treatment\n\nAny acute and severe illness may alter thyroid hormone deiodination through the effects of cytokines and result in various changes in levels of TSH, fT3 and fT4. Low TSH levels in hospitalised patients are three times more likely to be due to this effect than to hyperthyroidism.\n\nIt is therefore best to avoid thyroid function testing around the time of an acute illness unless there is good clinical evidence of a primary thyroid illness. If TFT remain deranged following recovery from acute illness then further investigation to assess for thyroid disease can be considered."

She had her normal insulin with breakfast at 07:30.\n\nYou review her at 11:30. The patient denies polyuria or polydipsia. She is clinically euvolaemic. She is medically stable and awaiting discharge from physiotherapy. You ask the nurse to check plasma ketones which return at 0.4mmol/l.

However, on postoperative scans, residual thyroid tissue is noted and after several months, her symptoms recur, including palpitations from atrial fibrillation. She is referred for radioiodine therapy.\n\nThree days before the radioiodine administration is due, she is admitted with acute-onset abdominal pain and, given the history of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic colitis is suspected. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen is performed with contrast, which rules out any acute pathology and so she is discharged.\n\nWith regards to the radioiodine therapy, when is the earliest that this can take place?\n\n- a) 3 days\n- b) 2 weeks\n- c) 8 weeks\n- d) 16 weeks\n- e) 26 weeks\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nRadioiodine therapy should be avoided until 8 weeks following CT contrast administration\n\nIodine in intravenous contrast interferes with the administration of radioiodine. As the levels of iodine in contrast are several hundred-fold higher than the recommended daily allowance, this may be retained by the body for months. As such, it can interfere with therapeutic uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. Various studies have demonstrated a 6-8 week time period is the minimum to wait before administering radioiodine, following CT contrast. 8 weeks is therefore the correct answer.\n\nGoing ahead with the procedure as planned, 3 days after this CT scan with contrast is therefore too soon. The contrast would interfere with the radioiodine.\n\nSimilarly, 2 weeks is still too soon to go ahead with the administration.\n\n16 weeks is an unnecessarily long amount of time to wait - 8 weeks is sufficient according to current studies.\n\nSimilarly, 26 weeks is longer than needed - the question asks what the earliest time of administration should be."

He gave a 10-year history of alcohol overuse and at that time had not had an alcoholic drink in 24 hours following an argument with his girlfriend where he vowed to give up alcohol. Prior to this he had been drinking 4-6 litres of cider per day plus additional spirits in variable amounts. He was admitted for detox and prescribed chlordiazepoxide, pabrinex and fluids. He has no other past medical history.\n\nNursing staff inform you that the patient has had no other seizures on this admission and has been eating and drinking small amounts today. However, he has been complaining of all over body pain and became confused 2-3 hours ago. The seizure is generalised tonic-clonic and self terminates after 3 minutes.\n\nOn examination post-seizure the patient is drowsy but responding to voice. His saturations are 100% on 15 litres oxygen via non-rebreathe mask and his temperature is 37.2 \u00baC. His heart rate is 110 beats per minute and blood pressure is 126/72 mmHg. His chest is clear, abdomen soft and non-tender and there is no focal neurology.\n\nRepeat blood tests and arterial blood gas are taken.\n\nWhich electrolyte abnormality is most likely to have caused his seizure?\n\n- a) Hypocalcaemia\n- b) Hypoglycaemia\n- c) Hypokalaemia\n- d) Hypomagnesaemia\n\n## e) Hypophosphataemia\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nHypophosphataemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality during alcohol withdrawal and is a recognised cause of seizures. It is often present at baseline in alcoholic patients and can further decrease in withdrawal. It is thought that this is due to effects on the proximal renal tubule. It can cause muscle pain and disorientation at very low levels (&lt; 0.3 mmol/l).\n\nHypoglycaemia would also be possible but in the absence of diabetes, and with the patient eating and drinking, this is less likely. Hypoglycaemia is common in patients intoxicated with alcohol and these patients should be monitored with regular capillary blood glucose testing.\n\nLow magnesium and low calcium both cause seizures but are unlikely to be lowered sufficiently in this patient to result in seizures in the absence of other clinical signs.\n\nLow potassium is unlikely to result in seizures."

This is because he has diabetes. A patient with diabetes should have an ACE inhibitor as first line treatment for diabetes regardless of their age. If the patient did not have diabetes, then a calcium channel blocker would be the most appropriate option. If the patient could not tolerate a ACE inhibitor then an angiotensin II receptor blocker should be tried. ACE inhibitors should also start for patients with diabetes if there is proteinuria, and therefore should have at least annual urinary albumin to creatinine ratios measured. Beta-blockers are only used after ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and alpha blockers have failed to controlled blood pressure.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSH-RAb, commonly shortened to TRAb) has an up to 98% sensitivity and 99% specificity for Graves' disease. If this test is negative, then a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan can help determine the cause. In Graves' disease there is diffuse high uptake, in thyroiditis there is low uptake, and if there are nodules then there is uneven uptake. US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology is recommended in the presence of features suggestive of malignancy. Liver function tests are important if there is a history of liver disease as carbimazole can cause further liver injury, but it would not help in determining the cause of hyperthyroidism"

No intra or extra hepatic duct dilation evident\n\nWhat treatment will reduce the risk of pancreatitis reoccurrence?\n\n- a) Ursodeoxycholic acid\n- b) Fenofibrate\n- c) Simvastatin\n- d) Nicotinic acid\n- e) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nFibrates are the most effective drug for treating hypertriglyceridaemia\n\nThe patient has clinical features of pancreatitis. The raised amylase confirms the diagnosis. The two most common causes of pancreatitis in the UK are excess alcohol and gallstones.\n\nThe normal liver function tests and ultrasound rule out gallstone disease as the cause. Therefore a laparoscopic cholecystectomy or treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is not indicated.\n\nThe patient drinks 4 glasses of wine per week. A 250ml glass of wine at 12% alcohol contains 250 * 0.12 = 30 ml of pure alcohol. 10 ml of pure alcohol = 1 unit. Therefore each glass of wine contains 3 unit. Her alcohol intake per week is therefore 12 units which is within the recommended intake. It is unlikely that alcohol is the cause.\n\nA patient has a significantly high triglyceride level. While gallstones and alcohol account for roughly 80% of cases of pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia is the next most common aetiology, accounting for roughly 1-4% of cases. The exact mechanism is unclear but it is thought to involve increased concentrations of chylomicrons in the blood. These low-density particles are very large and may obstruct capillaries leading to local ischemia and acidaemia. This local damage can expose triglycerides to pancreatic lipases.\n\nFibrates, statins, and nicotinic acid will all lower triglyceride levels, however, fibrates are the most effective drug in doing so.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve"

He had been diagnosed with primary small cell carcinoma of the lung six months ago and had declined curative chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis there was no evidence of metastasis, and his past medical history comprised of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and depression.\n\nHis wife had taken him to the Emergency Department having noted that he had been increasingly drowsy over the last few hours, as well as developing new onset confusion. He had otherwise been relatively well prior to the admission. He had consulted his GP about new onset generalised aches and pains within the last four weeks for which his GP had commenced Oramorph solution PRN. Since then he had developed abdominal pain which the GP had diagnosed as secondary to opiate-induced constipation and he was accordingly prescribed lactulose 15ml BD with partial relief of his symptoms. There had been no evidence of weakness or numbness and no evidence of speech impairment; as far as his wife was aware he had taken the prescribed dose of oramorph. His drug history comprised of oramorph solution 10mg BD, paracetamol 1g QDS, dihydrocodeine 60mg QDS, lactulose 15ml BD, aspirin 75mg OD, atorvastatin 20mg ON, bisoprolol 2.5mg OD, Ramipril 2.5mg OD and furosemide 40mg OD.\n\nExamination revealed a drowsy gentleman with a GCS of 12 (E 3 M5 V4). His blood pressure was 102/68, heart rate 58bpm, respiratory rate 10/min, oxygen saturations of 95% on air and temperature 36.6\u00baC. Examination of his cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable. Examination of his central nervous system revealed the presence of normal sized pupils; he was not compliant with formal neurological examination but no other focal neurological signs were found. There was no evidence of neck stiffness and Kernig's sign was negative. He was not cooperative with an abbreviated mental state examination.\n\nWhich investigation is most likely to be diagnostic of the underlying cause?\n\n- a) Urgent CT head scan\n- b) Urgent serum liver function and calcium profile\n- c) Urgent isotope bone scan\n- d) Urgent septic screen\n- e) Urgent PET scan\n\nThis gentleman has developed signs of life-threatening hypercalcaemia, having manifested previous potential symptoms including new onset abdominal pain and constipation. This question is asking what the single next most important investigation should be, and whilst most of the above options are relevant, candidates are asked to discriminate from what is deemed to be the next essential management should be. It is likely that he has developed metastasis to his spine thus whilst an isotope bone scan may be an important part of his overall management, it is not as relevant in the acute setting. Likewise, it is likely that a septic screen and CT head would be performed, but clinically speaking there is little definite evidence of acute raised intracranial pressure or sepsis. There is no indication at present that he is suffering from opiate toxicity and therefore IV naloxone should not be administered at this stage."

He had presented with a two month history of polyuria, polydipsia and diarrhoea and was found to have a blood sugar of 18.4 mmol/L. Over this time period he had lost 6kg and now weighed 61kg. His past medical history includes hypertension and a deep vein thrombosis which was diagnosed three months ago. He takes amlodipine 10mg and warfarin.\n\nWhat is the diagnosis?\n\n- a) Glucagonoma\n- b) Type one diabetes mellitus\n- c) Cushing's syndrome\n- d) Drug induced diabetes\n- e) Type two diabetes mellitus\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nGlucagonoma is an uncommon tumour of the pancreatic alpha cells. It can present with new or worsening diabetes mellitus, venous thromboembolism, the classic rash of necrolytic migratory erythema (a painful, pruritic maculopapular rash occuring typically at sites of friction with clothing...) and other symptoms of hyperglucagonaemia (diarrhoea, weight loss, anaemia). Type one diabetes mellitus can of course present with the osmotic symptoms of hyperglycaemia and weight loss but would be unlikely in a patient of this age with no history of autoimmune disease. Type two diabetes mellitus would be uncommon in a non-obese older patient and is less likely to present with osmotic symptoms."

He had Type 2 diabetes for the past 7 years and is currently treated with metformin, sitagliptin and empagliflozin. He tells you he has lost some 5kg in weight over the past month. On examination his blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, his pulse is 85 beats per minute and regular. Emergency blood testing reveal elevated ketones and a glucose of 12.2 mmol/l.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his glucose\n\n## control?\n\n- a) Add liraglutide\n- b) Add long-acting insulin\n- c) Change the empagliflozin for liraglutide\n- d) Change the empagliflozin for long-acting insulin\n- e) Stop the metformin\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nGiven the duration of Type 2 diabetes and the fact that patient has lost weight in the past month, the possibility that he is insulinopenic is raised. In this situation, calorie loss and metabolic disturbance can be exacerbated by the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and patients may present as here, with euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The SGLT-2 inhibitor should be withdrawn, and given he is insulinopaenic, long-acting insulin added.\n\nIn this situation the empagliflozin must be withdrawn, therefore options including adding liraglutide and long-acting insulin are incorrect. GLP-1 agonists such as liraglutide work less well in patients who are relatively insulinopenic, so liraglutide is incorrect. Stopping the metformin won't remove the cause of ketosis, the empagliflozin."

Due to increased glucocorticoid production, symptoms include weight gain and hyperglycaemia as seen in this patient. Hypertension is another common finding also seen here. Laboratory tests may reveal hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The best test to diagnose Cushing's syndrome is the low-dose dexamethasone test. This has been done for this patient and shows a cortisol level that has not been suppressed despite exogenous steroid use. Once Cushing's syndrome has been confirmed, additional localisation tests need to be completed. One of these includes the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test which is used to discriminate between Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production. Suppressed cortisol levels following high doses of glucocorticoids confirms a pituitary cause, as opposed to normal levels of cortisol that suggest an adrenal cause.\n\nThe insulin stress test is used to differentiate Cushing's syndrome from pseudoCushing's. Pseudo-Cushing's presents similarly to Cushing's syndrome; however, rather than being caused by excessive corticosteroid levels, it is due to alcohol excess or severe depression. There is nothing in this patient's history to suggest depression or alcohol excess. Furthermore, the positive finding following the lowdose dexamethasone suppression test points away from a diagnosis of pseudoCushing's.\n\nPetrosal sinus ACTH sampling is another investigation that can be used to help distinguish between a pituitary or adrenal cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is an invasive investigation and easier tests such as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test should be considered first.\n\nA pituitary MRI can be used to diagnose a pituitary cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the next recommended investigation. Rather, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is easier and cheaper to complete and should be completed next.\n\nUrinary cortisol is used as an initial investigation in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is not a specific localisation test."

Due to increased glucocorticoid production, symptoms include weight gain and hyperglycaemia as seen in this patient. Hypertension is another common finding also seen here. Laboratory tests may reveal hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The best test to diagnose Cushing's syndrome is the low-dose dexamethasone test. This has been done for this patient and shows a cortisol level that has not been suppressed despite exogenous steroid use. Once Cushing's syndrome has been confirmed, additional localisation tests need to be completed. One of these includes the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test which is used to discriminate between Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production. Suppressed cortisol levels following high doses of glucocorticoids confirms a pituitary cause, as opposed to normal levels of cortisol that suggest an adrenal cause.\n\nThe insulin stress test is used to differentiate Cushing's syndrome from pseudoCushing's. Pseudo-Cushing's presents similarly to Cushing's syndrome; however, rather than being caused by excessive corticosteroid levels, it is due to alcohol excess or severe depression. There is nothing in this patient's history to suggest depression or alcohol excess. Furthermore, the positive finding following the lowdose dexamethasone suppression test points away from a diagnosis of pseudoCushing's.\n\nPetrosal sinus ACTH sampling is another investigation that can be used to help distinguish between a pituitary or adrenal cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is an invasive investigation and easier tests such as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test should be considered first.\n\nA pituitary MRI can be used to diagnose a pituitary cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the next recommended investigation. Rather, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is easier and cheaper to complete and should be completed next.\n\nUrinary cortisol is used as an initial investigation in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is not a specific localisation test."

Although anticholinergic drugs are first-line, this is recommended as an acceptable alternative when they are contra- indicated.\n\nAnticholinergic drugs (such as darifenacin, oxybutynin and tolterodine ) are first line, but there are some safety concerns, particularly in elderly patients at risk of delirium. This makes these options incorrect choices for this patient, who has been admitted recently with delirium.\n\nDuloxetine is incorrect.

If the urinary K+ is high check the blood pressure, which is this case is normal. Liddle's Syndrome would cause hypertension.\n\nIf the patient is not hypertensive check the bicarbonate if it is low such as in this case the diagnosis is renal tubular acidosis. The clue here is that the patient has a history of renal stones meaning that the diagnosis is renal tubular acidosis type 1.\n\nRenal tubular acidosis type 2 is associated with conditions such as Wilson's disease, lead poisoning and myeloma."

His occupation as a lorry driver precludes medication which may significantly increase his risk of hypoglycaemia. This effectively rules out insulin initiation unless he is prepared to accept any impact on his job. Insulin would also promote further weight gain and salt and water retention, and is therefore less desirable as an option. Pioglitazone promotes weight gain and fluid retention, so again is not really an option.\n\nThis leaves us with the two switching scenarios. Switching to liraglutide is preferred, because in trials GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to reduce HbA1c by similar levels to basal insulin, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, and promote approximately 3% weight loss over a 6 month period. DPPIV inhibitors such as linagliptin are potentially less effective in reducing HbA1c than sulphonylureas and linagliptin is therefore not an option here."

He has been becoming worse over four days since eating a barbecued piece of chicken he suspects was undercooked. Since then he has had diarrhoea and vomiting and has recently been noticing abdominal pain. His wife brought him to the emergency department as she felt he was starting to become drowsy. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, steatohepatitis and stable angina. He normally takes metformin, dapagliflozin, aspirin, omeprazole, paracetamol and bisoprolol. Investigations reveal that he has a serum glucose of 12.1 mmol/L, a pH of 6.9 and urine testing reveal +++ of ketones. He is diagnosed with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis.

Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor which reduces glucose reabsorption in the urine and increases urinary glucose excretion. This patient has developed one of the side effects of dapagliflozin; DKA. DKA secondary to SGLT2 dapagliflozin is more likely to be euglycaemic than DKA in general. Metformin is associated with metabolic acidosis, especially in the context of reduced renal function or alcohol, and bisoprolol can cause hypoglycaemia. Steatohepatitis can eventually result in hepatic failure causing impaired gluconeogenesis, but this is more likely to result in hypoglycaemia rather than DKA. Angina is unlikely to be relevant."

Reflexes in the upper limbs are reduced. Muscle tone is normal. Chest sounds clear but expansion is reduced bilaterally. GCS is 15/15.\n\nThe patient describes similar episodes in the past that have lasted for only minutes, the episodes decreased in frequency after commencing a ketogenic diet. They had been attributed to hemiplegic migraines, though she had had bilateral symptoms.\n\nFrom the following options, what investigation will be most helpful in confirming\n\n## the likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) CT head\n- b) Electromyography\n- c) Lumbar puncture\n- d) MRI brain and spinal cord\n- e) Urea &amp; electrolytes\n\nEpisodes of weakness, hypokalaemia, symptoms triggered by carbohydrate meals \u2192 hypokalaemic periodic paralysis\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is a periodic paralysis of which hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is the most common. Attacks can be precipitated by high-carbohydrate meals which explains why the number of episodes reduced for this patient when she commenced on a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet.\n\nDifferentials might include myasthenia gravis (though this is commonly associated with fatigable weakness rather than 'attacks'), metabolic myopathies (which involve weakness typically worsened by exercise), or in a first attack Guillain-Barre, transverse myelitis, of infective paralysis (tick paralysis, botulism) may be considered.\n\nUrea and electrolytes is the correct answer. A low potassium level would make the diagnosis here clearer. Average potassium levels in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are around 2.4mmol/L. If hypokalaemia is significantly low, less than 2.0mmol/L for example, you should think about secondary causes of hypokalaemia such as losses from the gut, and renal losses.\n\nMRI brain and spinal cord is incorrect. This would be a reasonable investigation to investigate the possibility of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, the pattern of weakness does not fit a particular cerebral or spinal territory which you would expect with MS.\n\nElectromyography is incorrect. Although this would be able to demonstrate myopathy during an acute attack, it would not assist us in determining the specific underlying diagnosis as there are many causes of myopathy.\n\nLumbar puncture is incorrect. A lumbar puncture would be helpful in looking for inflammatory or infective causes of neurological symptoms, but would not be able to confirm a diagnosis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Given the episodic nature of the attacks, transverse myelitis or infection, for example, would not explain the symptoms here.\n\nCT head is incorrect. This patient's symptoms are recurrent and do not correspond to a particular cerebral territory. A CT head would be unhelpful in confirming the likely diagnosis."

Most prevalent in young females, diagnosis is clinched on fine needle aspiration. The key considerations for treatment are the size of the thyroid mass and the presence of lymph node involvement: any lump greater than 1cm in size or has any signs of metastatic spread should undergo thyroidectomy instead of a lobectomy. The postoperative use of concurrent radioiodine ablation enhances survival benefits in patients at high risk of disease recurrence and is recommended by both the American Thyroid association and a European consensus group. Patients with thyroid lumps greater than 4cm in diameter regardless of extrathyroid disease; those with lumps between 1 and 4cm in diameter and extra-thyroid disease; and all with high-risk histology such as aggressive histological subtypes benefit from radioiodine ablation. In the case of this patient with a 2.5cm mass and lymph node involvement, thyroidectomy, lymph node clearance with neck dissection and postoperative radioiodine ablation is appropriate. Annual monitoring is thus an unsafe option."

In this case, the serum demonstrates a metabolic acidosis with normal bicarbonate and urinary pH greater than 5.5, ruling out type 1 and 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). WaterhouseFriedrichsen syndrome is caused by adrenal haemorrhage, classically secondary to tuberculosis or meningococcal infection, which if present, should be visualised on CT imaging. He does not demonstrate circulatory collapse, abdominal pain or nausea suggestive of Addisonian crisis. Type 4 RTA, causing a failure of the sodium-potassium antiporter is thus the most appropriate diagnosis, in the context of a patient with chronic steroid use and hence predisposition for adrenal insufficiency during acute severe illness."

The patient will require cross-sectional imaging to localise the phaeochromocytoma. Treatment should be initiated in the interim to control symptoms.\n\nPhenoxybenzamine is the correct answer. Alpha-blockers should be initiated firstline. Initiation of beta-blockers before alpha-blockade will cause unopposed stimulation of alpha-receptors, causing vasoconstriction and hypertensive crisis.\n\nAtenolol is the incorrect answer. Atenolol is a beta-blocker and will cause unopposed stimulation of alpha receptors.\n\nBisoprolol is the incorrect answer.

This process is most effective in achieving successful pregnancy.\n\nClomiphene does induce ovulation and is useful in patients with other conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome. It is however very unlikely to be effective in patients with gonadotrophin failure like Kallmann syndrome. Metformin has previously been used in the management of PCOS.

In the event that fertility treatment isn't successful, adoption can be considered."

    "block": "## Question #56\n\nA 35-year-old makes an urgent appointment in the diabetes clinic. She has had type 1 diabetes since the age of 20 but has controlled this well with insulin. She has no other medical problems and since diagnosed during a hospital admission with diabetic ketoacidosis has had no further hospital admissions or problems. She is concerned because she has fallen pregnant and wants to makes sure that she is not doing anything to harm the foetus. She is not looking to have a termination. She found out after she missed her period one week ago and took two pregnancy tests which were both positive. She had been taking a basal-bolus regime of insulin as well as atorvastatin. She had retinal screening and urine testing nine months ago. Her HbA1c was last measured three months ago at 39mmol/mol. She has been advised to continue with her insulin. She has also stopped the atorvastatin due to concerns about its effects in pregnancy. What is the most appropriate action to avoid complications of diabetes?\n\n- a) Restart atorvastatin\n- b) Increase short-acting insulin dose\n- c) Advise termination of pregnancy\n- d) Refer for retinal screening\n- e) Increase basal insulin dose\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nPatients with diabetes should have increased frequency of retinal screening during pregnancy due to increased risk of retinopathy\n\nThe most appropriate plan is to repeat the retinal screening and test the urine. In diabetes, patients should achieve good diabetic control prior to planning for pregnancy. If this has not been achieved, then NICE advises contraception and to offer termination if pregnancy does occur due to increased risks in pregnancy. This patient has good diabetic control as evidenced by the lack of complications and HbA1c. When anticipating pregnancy, contraindicated drugs such as atorvastatin and ACE inhibitors should be stopped. Labetalol is an appropriate option for blood pressure control. The dose of insulin does not automatically need to be adjusted up or down but blood glucose would need close monitoring during pregnancy. It is advised, however, if the patient has not had retinal screening within the last six months to offer this urgently as there can be rapid development of diabetic retinopathy in pregnancy."

This patient has hypercalcemia with low urinary calcium, which narrows the diagnosis down to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or thiazide diuretic usage (other causes of hypercalcemia tend to cause elevated urinary calcium). The diagnosis of FHH is clinched by the inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone. This is because, in FHH, loss of function mutations in the CASR calcium-sensing receptor decrease sensitivity to calcium, meaning PTH remains unsuppressed at higher-than-normal serum calcium levels. Hypocalciuria results from a loss of CASR-mediated negative feedback of tubular reabsorption/ excretion of calcium.\n\nChlorthalidone use is incorrect, as this would give hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia with a suppressed PTH.\n\nHypercalcaemia of malignancy with ectopic parathyroid hormone-related protein secretion is incorrect. This would classically lead to hypercalciuria. In addition, serum PTH may be suppressed rather than inappropriately normal in this scenario, as the PTHrp peptide is detected by a different assay from the conventional PTH assay.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. Although this could explain the hypercalcaemia and inappropriately normal PTH, this would lead to hypercalciuria rather than hypocalciuria.\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. Here, PTH is released in response to hypocalcaemia, often in the context of renal disease. The elevated serum calcium and normal renal function seen in this patient do not support this diagnosis."

The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterised by metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia, and ketonaemia. Management involves intravenous normal saline for rehydration, insulin therapy at a rate of 6.3 units/h (based on the patient's body weight of 63 kg), and potassium replacement at 40 mmol/L because the patient's serum potassium is within the range of 3.5-5.5 mmol/L.\n\nIV normal saline, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L potassium are incorrect because the appropriate insulin infusion rate should be calculated as 0.1 unit/kg/hour; for a patient weighing 63 kg, this equates to an infusion rate of 6.3 units/hour.\n\n## IV normal saline, 63 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L\n\npotassium represents a significant overdose of insulin. The correct dosage should be based on the standard DKA management protocol of administering insulin at a dose of 0.1 unit/kg/hour, resulting in an infusion rate of 6.3 units/hour for this patient.\n\nIV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is not the appropriate choice here as it underestimates the required rate of insulin infusion (should be set at 6.3 units/h instead). Moreover, leukocytosis can occur associated with hyperglycaemia and DKA; thus, it should not automatically prompt antibiotic administration without further evidence suggestive of infection.\n\nIV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is incorrect due to the unnecessary inclusion of antibiotics in the treatment regimen. As previously stated, leukocytosis can be associated with both hyperglycaemia and DKA; therefore, it does not justify empirical antibiotic therapy without other clinical indications pointing towards an infectious process."

He was admitted for an elective parathyroidectomy three days ago for fairly long standing hyperparathyroidism and subsequent hypercalcaemia. He had a single parathyroid adenoma excised which had been identified on pre-operative MIBI scanning. The procedure was without complications but he is now complaining of a tingling sensation in his fingers that he first noticed about twelve hours ago. He also complains of new severe pain in both of his ankles which is worse when he walks, but also present at rest. The surgical SHO has already arranged x-rays of the patient's ankles and these reveal multiple osteolytic lesions which have been reported as being suspicious for metastatic disease. He is otherwise fit and well and his only regular medications are paracetamol, tramadol and prophylactic dalteparin. His blood tests are as follows.\n\nAdjusted Calcium\n\n1.84 mmol/L\n\nMagnesium\n\n0.7 mmol/L\n\nWhat is the most likely explanation for his current symptoms?\n\n- a) Metastatic parathyroid cancer\n- b) Secondary hyperparathyroidism\n- c) Hypomagnesaemia\n- d) Hungry bone syndrome\n- e) Secondary hypoparathyroidism\n\nHypocalcaemia after parathyroid surgery is relatively common and usually 'benign' and associated with a transient hypoparathyroidism. However, it can sometimes be more marked and give rise to symptoms such as perioral or finger paraesthesia. This state alone would not, however, explain his ankle pain or x-ray findings.\n\nAlthough hypomagnesaemia may also be present and should be treated, it does not explain the symptoms. Metastatic parathyroid cancer is a possibility given the x-ray findings, but is very uncommon and is less likely given that his hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia was long standing (i.e. indolent). Secondary hyperparathyroidism is the syndrome of appropriately raised parathyroid hormone in response to hypocalcaemia, usually secondary to chronic kidney disease.

His repeat measurements showed consistently high readings so the GP added amlodipine, which had very little effect despite being tolerated at the maximum dose. After failing to get an adequate response with the addition of a third agent the GP referred the patient to the endocrine clinic.\n\nObservations showed a blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg and a heart rate of 98 beats per minute. On examination, the man was thin with a body mass index of 23 kg/m\u00b2. His apex was diffuse and displaced with normal heart sounds. The chest was clear and abdomen was soft and non-tender with no evidence of masses or renal bruits.

The history of fatigue, anorexia and nausea points towards this, along with evidence of hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, hypotension, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. A primary failure is known as Addison's disease. To make the initial diagnosis of adrenal failure, a short Synacthen test should be used - cortisol will fail to rise. However, the question is asking specifically how to differentiate primary from secondary adrenal failure, secondary being a failure of the pituitary to make sufficient ACTH. For this, the long Synacthen test should be used - a higher dose is given and then cortisol levels measured over a longer time period. With primary failure, the adrenals will still be unable to produce cortisol, but with secondary failure, the exogenous ACTH will eventually push the adrenals to produce cortisol.\n\nThe high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate primary and secondary causes of Cushing's syndrome, not adrenal insufficiency. This would have instead presented with weight gain and hypokalemia, not the other way around.\n\nThe low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used first-line to make the initial diagnosis of Cushing's. It does not play a role here.\n\nThe short Synacthen test is used to initially diagnose adrenal insufficiency. It does not, however, differentiate between primary and secondary causes - the long test does this.\n\nUrinary metanephrines are used to diagnose pheochromocytoma. In this condition, there is increased secretion of catecholamines and patients present with hypertension, headaches, sweating and palpitations."

This rare autosomal dominant syndrome is due to dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus, leading to the Na channel not being degraded, thus leading to chronic reabsorption of sodium and water in the nephron. This mimics a state of hyperaldosteronism as aldosterone is usually the hormone implicated in inserting the ENaCs into the nephron. Therefore, this patient has a state of hypervolaemic hypernatraemia with chronically high blood pressure creating the end-organ damage to the optic nerve and heart described above.\n\nThe feedback loop in the kidneys has meant that both renin and aldosterone are low for her body to attempt to lower the sodium and water retention. This patient is fatigued and constipated due to hypokalaemia. Liddle's is treated with a combination of a low sodium diet and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride).\n\nLiddle's has a classic triad in the textbooks of hypertension, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. However, hypernatraemia is also a feature due to the above processes and this should not be forgotten in the clinical work-up.\n\nBartter's syndrome is an incorrect option. This is an autosomal recessive syndrome which causes salt-wasting from the kidney and subsequently a state of hyperaldosteronism and usually low blood pressure, not high blood pressure as seen in this case.\n\nGitelman's syndrome is an incorrect option as it is another autosomal recessive syndrome similar to Bartter's, which causes low blood pressure usually.\n\nExcess salt in the diet is incorrect. Even though it would cause hypernatraemia and chronic excess would cause states of hypertension; you would not find hypokalaemia. Furthermore, it would be a more unlikely cause at the young age of this patient with the anti-hypertensive therapy resistance.\n\nRenal artery stenosis is an incorrect answer because this condition causes difficulty to control hypertension with a high plasma renin activity found, instead of low, as more renin is produced in response to the low pressure sensed by the constricted renal artery. The kidneys think that the blood pressure is systemically low when it is a locally mediated effect from the stenosis.\n\nDiscuss (5)Improve"

What is the most likely cause of her presentation?\n\n- a) Delayed autoimmune reaction secondary to contrast medium\n- b) Atypical pneumonia\n- c) Missed pulmonary embolism with right heart strain\n- d) Thyroid storm\n- e) Heparin induced thrombocytopenia\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nIodine in CT contrast media can precipitate thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm\n\nThe correct answer is thyroid storm. The iodine in the CT contrast medium can trigger thyrotoxicosis and thyroid storm. The features of hyperpyrexia, agitation, confusion, AF with a fast ventricular rate in a patient with known hyperthyroidism following a triggering event, such as CT contrast, infection or surgery can thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm. An autoimmune reaction is unlikely given the absence of rash and presence of fever and agitation. Pneumonia is unlikely without any radiological features on the CT scan and also with the absence of a cough, and missing pulmonary embolism is unlikely, but it is also unlikely to miss right heart strain on CT"

In combination, used for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome, the most likely diagnosis here, co-cyprindiol significantly reduces symptoms of hirsutism and acne, both related to androgen excess.\n\nClomiphene is the preferred option for inducing ovulation, and is preferred to metformin for this purpose, although the two are sometimes used in combination in the obese population. Pioglitazone is also effective in reducing ovarian insulin resistance, and inducing ovulation, but is not used due to its adverse event profile. Progesterone, (levonorgestrel), is ineffective in managing hirsutism."

The patient has hypercalcaemia with a raised PTH level. Plausible differentials include primary hyperparathyroidism, tertiary hyperparathyroidism and familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops in patients with longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism (typically as a consequence of CKD, which is absent here). Primary hyperparathyroidism is not listed as an option. Therefore, familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia is the correct answer.\n\nMultiple myeloma is incorrect. Classically, malignancies cause a suppressed PTH level if they are the cause of hypercalcemia. This is true of multiple myeloma.\n\nSarcoidosis is incorrect. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is due to the uncontrolled production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 by macrophages. This causes hypercalcemia and a suppressed PTH. unlike in some forms of hyperparathyroidism, the negative feedback mechanism whereby high calcium causes a low PTH is maintained.\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. This form of hyperparathyroidism occurs as an appropriate reaction to low vitamin D or calcium. In this case, the vitamin is normal and the calcium is high.\n\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect.

She is also overweight and is markedly stressed by her physical appearance and the development of stretch marks over her abdomen. She has tried multiple hair removal techniques with only mild success.\n\nOn examination, she has a body mass index of 28 kg/m\u00b2, coarse hair over the anterior and posterior part of her chest and under her chin.

It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21 hydroxylase in the steroid biosynthetic pathway. The result is a shift in the production of steroid hormones towards the androgenic pathway. Since cortisol secretion is reduced, feedback leads to increased ACTH production and resultant hyperplasia of the adrenals. The level of the compounds that are formed prior to the action of 21 hydroxylase is increased, therefore levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone are elevated. Due to excessive androgen production, there is virilization and hirsutism.\n\nTreatment involves steroids given in reverse circadian rhythm, i.e. a higher dosage at night and a lower dose in the morning.\n\nThe rationale behind this approach is due to the pathophysiology of CAH. The adrenal hyperplasia and the over-secretion of adrenal androgens are due to excessive ACTH production. When steroids are given in higher doses at night, ACTH is suppressed and the normal physiological steroid peak in the morning is also reduced.\n\nCysts in the ovaries are a common finding on routine ultrasound and do not necessarily represent polycystic ovarian syndrome."

Following the delivery her glycaemic control has failed to improve and she has been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is only slightly overweight (body mass index 27.1 kg/m\u00b2) and you are worried about missing maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or type 1 diabetes. Which one of the following is most suggestive of MODY?\n\n- a) Ketosis during periods of hyperglycaemi\n- b) Family history of early onset diabetes mellitus\n- c) A history of polycystic ovarian syndrome\n- d) Lack of response to sulphonylureas\n- e) A history of autoimmune disease\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nMODY is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion so a family history is often present\n\nThe correct answer is a family history of early onset diabetes mellitus . Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of monogenic disorders characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually before 25 years of age), and a primary defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. A family history of early onset diabetes mellitus is most suggestive of MODY because it indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition to the condition, which is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern seen in MODY.\n\nKetosis during periods of hyperglycaemia is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes rather than MODY. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to an absolute insulin deficiency. In the absence of sufficient insulin, the body relies on breaking down fats for energy, resulting in ketone production and ketosis. In contrast, patients with MODY typically have a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function but still produce some insulin, so they are less likely to develop ketosis.\n\nA history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is not particularly suggestive of MODY. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some forms of MODY can be associated with insulin resistance, it would not be considered the most characteristic feature when trying to differentiate between types of diabetes.\n\nLack of response to sulphonylureas can be seen in some subtypes of MODY (e.g., MODY 1 and MODY 3). However, it does not necessarily rule out other types or subtypes since there are several different genetic defects that can cause MODY. Furthermore, lack of response to sulphonylureas could also occur in type 2 diabetics who have progressed to needing insulin therapy.\n\nA history of autoimmune disease is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes, as it results from an autoimmune process that destroys pancreatic beta cells. While there is no strong association between MODY and autoimmune diseases, a history of autoimmune disease could increase the likelihood of developing other types of diabetes, such as type 1 or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)."

He had a past medical history of epilepsy and mentions that he has had 'brain surgery' in the past. He is on some medications but cannot remember the names. He has no allergies.\n\nOn assessment, he has no focal neurological deficit and cardiovascular/respiratory examination is normal. Observations show a blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg (dropping to 105/82 mmHg on standing), a heart rate of 67 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.2 degrees, oxygen saturations of 94% on air and a respiratory rate of 18/min.

Though the details of this are obscured in the question, it is likely that removal of a pituitary mass with trans-sphenoidal surgery. This is exhibited by fairly non-descript symptoms coupled with some underlying evidence of lack of anterior pituitary hormones: low BP/dizziness/postural hypotension, high/normal K+, low/normal Na+ and low/normal blood glucose all indicate lack of cortisol due to low ACTH; the low/normal temperature and heart rate and the tiredness steer you towards low thyroxine level due to lack of TSH.\n\nThis gentleman needs assessment of his pituitary function. This can be done in many ways. A baseline pituitary hormone profile can be quite useful; however the most definitive tests involve assessing dynamic pituitary function. The insulin stress test (coupled with TRH and GnRH tests) creates a hypoglycaemic effect in the body and the response of the pituitary (cortisol surge) is measured. However, inducing hypoglycaemia in epileptics, such as this gentleman, is contraindicated. Therefore the next best investigation is the glucagon stimulation test which mimics hypoglycaemia in the body and causes a fake stress on the pituitary, therefore being safe to use in epileptics.\n\nA 29-year-old woman comes to the clinic with feelings of anxiety, palpitations and a resting tremor present over the past 2 weeks. She also has symptoms of a flulike illness and pain over her anterior neck. On examination,you reveal tenderness over the thyroid. Her blood pressure is 115/88 mmHg, she has a fine tremor at rest, sweaty palms and a tachycardia of 88 beats per minute. TSH is &lt;0.05 U/ml.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate intervention?\n\n- a) Thyroxine\n- b) Carbimazole\n- c) Propylthiouracil\n- d) Carbimazole and thyroxine\n- e) Propranolol\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nThe short history of flu-like symptoms, coupled with pain over the thyroid gland is consistent with a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. The presentation with thyrotoxicosis is caused by a transient increase in thyroid hormone release, rather than over production, hence anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. Symptomatic relief with propranolol is indicated, as are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for management of pain and inflammation. A period of hypothyroidism may follow, with later recovery to normal thyroid function.\n\nAnti-thyroid drugs are not needed, carbimazole and propylthiouracil are therefore incorrect, as is the block-replace regimen option. Although a transient period of hypothyroidism may be seen after the thyrotoxicosis subsides, thyroxine replacement is usually not needed.\n\nDiscuss (4)Improve"

Symptomatic patients present with symptoms identical to those taking excessive thiazide diuretics - hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hyponatraemia. Patients are normotensive. Importantly, patients also display hypocalciuria, which differentiates the condition from Bartter syndrome. Treatment involves salt replacement.\n\nBartter syndrome is a similar condition, except that it involves a mutation in the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in the loop of Henle. As such, the condition mimics loop diuretic abuse. Whilst also presenting with hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and normotension, the condition crucially presents with hypercalciuria, rather than hypocalciuria as seen in Gitelman syndrome.\n\nDent disease is a rare X-linked recessive condition that affects the proximal tubules.

The frequency of repeat colonoscopy should depend on the findings at the original screening and the activity of the underlying acromegaly\n\nThe clinical features and results of the oral glucose tolerance test confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly. In normal a rise in glucose should cause suppression of growth hormone (GH) to undetectable values.\n\nCardiovascular disease is highly prevalent in Acromegaly due to a combination of risk factors associated with this disease, in particular, secondary diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Patients should therefore be screened for cardiovascular risk factors and these should be managed aggressively. A transthoracic echo would be prudent to perform, however transesophageal echocardiography is unnecessary.\n\nPatients with acromegaly have high levels of insulin like growth factor which predisposes to malignancy, in particularly colorectal carcinoma. Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and CT colonography can all be used to screen for colorectal carcinoma, however colonoscopy is the most sensitive test making this the best answer.\n\nPatients with acromegaly should be offered regular colonoscopic screening, starting at the age of 40 years.

This should prompt you to work out the anion gap which can be extremely useful diagnostically.\n\nThe anion gap in this example = sum of positive cations - sum of negative anions = (Na + K) - (HCO3 + Cl) = 9.1 We are therefore dealing with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).\n\nHigh anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) is generally caused by the following conditions which can be remembered with the mnemonic KULT\n\n- \uf0b7 Ketoacidosis: diabetic, starvation or alcoholic\n- \uf0b7 Uraemia\n- \uf0b7 Lactic acidosis\n- \uf0b7 Toxins e.g. salicylates, ethylene glycol, methanol\n\nNormal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) is generally caused by the following conditions which can be remembered with the mnemonic ABCD\n\n- \uf0b7 Addison's disease\n- \uf0b7 Bicarbonate loss via GI tract (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal tract (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)\n- \uf0b7 Chloride excess - hyperchloraemic acidosis\n- \uf0b7 Drugs e.g. acetazolamide\n\nIn this case, the NAGMA, hypokalaemia, and renal stones should prompt you to consider renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The presence of kidney stones, and the past medical history of Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis make RTA type 1 (distal) the most likely diagnosis. Treatment of RTA involves correction of the acidaemia with oral sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or potassium citrate."

The first step involved intravenous followed by oral beta-blockade. Diltiazem is an appropriate alternative if the patient cannot tolerate beta blockers. In cases of simultaneous poor ventricular function and thyroid storm, intravenous infusions of short-acting beta blockers such as esmolol are also appropriate, which can be switched off immediately at the earliest sign of worsening cardiac function secondary to beta blockade. Thyroid blockers can be instituted after this immediate therapy. Oral corticosteroids are also important to reduce peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. However, both treatments can be instituted after achieving haemodynamic stability."

It is most commonly seen in patients with a background of Grave's disease but can occur in other scenarios too. There is usually a precipitating insult such as diabetic ketoacidosis or a heart attack.\n\nThe likelihood of a thyroid storm can be calculated using the Burch and Wartofksy thyroid storm diagnostic criteria. This attributes points to the presence of pyrexia, tachycardia, signs of heart failure, confusion, coma, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbance etc.\n\nIn this case, the patient scores 90. A score of &gt;45 indicates a likely thyroid storm. The patient also has a suppressed TSH level with raised T4, this cements the diagnosis.\n\nIn an ideal situation treatment for presumed thyroid storm should not be delayed whilst awaiting blood results as this condition has significant mortality (&gt;10%). Blood tests may be in keeping with hyperthyroidism, but there is no specific cut- off to diagnose thyroid storm, the diagnosis is made on clinical findings.\n\nPropylthiouracil is the correct answer. Patients should be assessed with an ABCDE approach and stabilised. IV fluids and cooling are important aspects of treatment. Tachyarrhythmias should also be managed according to local guidelines. The most appropriate treatment for the underlying thyroid storm is propylthiouracil. This inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and also inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3.\n\nCarbimazole is incorrect. Although carbimazole can be used, propylthiouracil is the traditionally preferred treatment as it has a faster onset of action and also inhibits the conversion of fT4 to T3.\n\nThyroidectomy is incorrect. This can be used as a definitive treatment for Grave's disease and can also be used in the acute setting if a patient has had a previous poor reaction to thionamides such as propylthiouracil. Usually, the first-line treatment would be stabilisation with beta-blockers, supportive treatment and oral thionamides.\n\nIV antibiotics is incorrect. In this case, the patient is pyrexial and has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain could indicate an intra-abdominal infection. It would not be unusual for the patient to receive IV antibiotics in this scenario to cover for potential infection, but given the blood results here - normal white cell count, normal CRP, and deranged thyroid function - we can be quite sure of a diagnosis of thyroid storm which wouldn't respond to IV antibiotics. The concomitant atrial fibrillation with signs of heart failure (pedal oedema), extreme pyrexia, and delirium, are better explained by thyroid storm.\n\n300mg aspirin is incorrect. This would be the treatment of stroke. There is an altered conscious level with behavioural changes and pyrexia, both of which can be seen in acute stroke. There are, however, no focal neurological findings described and a stroke would not explain the change in bowel habit and abdominal pain."

This ensures a smooth transfer from fixed rate to usual insulin regimen when the patient has clinically and biochemically improved."

Evidence in this patient group is strong for a putative benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors. In particular both empagliflozin and canagliflozin have reported outcomes data which demonstrates a reduction in mortality of around 1/3rd. Their outcome trials also demonstrate a reduction in episodes of symptomatic cardiac failure and reduced progression of microvascular complications of diabetes.\n\nThe other options are all inappropriate. Adding gliclazide is associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia, weight gain, and is not associated with positive cardiovascular outcomes. In particular, given his occupation as a taxi driver, hypoglycaemia should be avoided. Insulin glargine may promote significant weight gain, can worsen cardiac failure and does also cause hypoglycaemia. Pioglitazone promotes weight gain and fluid retention and is therefore contraindicated in cardiac failure. Saxagliptin was associated with an increase in cardiac failure in the SAVOR-TIMI cardiac outcome trial."

In spite of this, he is still suffering from hypoglycaemia episodes as a result of delivering his insulin as a twice a day regimen. Moving him to basal bolus will allow splitting up of the short acting component of his insulin requirements, and therefore reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia at the end of each dosing period.\n\nReducing the dose of his mixed insulin may drive a further rise in his HbA1c, as would reducing the dose of metformin. Switching to Humalog mix 20 will increase the proportion of long-acting insulin and worsen the risk of hypoglycaemia. Eating a snack will drive weight gain and worsen his HbA1c.\n\nA 32-year-old patient is due to be discharged from hospital. He has had his third admission for DKA in the last two years since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. He has come off his fixed-rate IV insulin and started to eat and drink again, and has restarted his long-acting insulin detemir (Levemir) and shortacting insulin aspart (Novorapid) as his pre-admission plan. His DKA was most likely provoked by the patient drinking alcohol and not taking his insulin. This is similar to previous admissions, but he only drinks two bottles of beer a week, but occasionally binge drinks. He has no other co-morbidities and takes no other medications. What is the most appropriate suggestion to avoid further admissions with DKA?\n\n- a) Start metformin\n- b) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin degludec (Tresiba)\n- c) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30)\n- d) Increase dose in insulin aspart (Novorapid) by 20%\n- e) Advise reduction in carbohydrates in diet\n\nCorrect answr is b.\n\nA patient with recurrent admissions for DKA can be started on degludec to reduce readmission rate\n\nThis is a patient with type 1 diabetes with recurrent DKA secondary to a combination of missing doses of insulin and binge drinking alcohol. The most appropriate and likely to be successful strategy is to change Levemir to Degludec. Degludec has a much higher half-life than Levemir and therefore maintains a basal insulin level when the patient omits or forgets doses. This can prevent DKA. Metformin is not indicated for this patient. Insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30) would allow reduction in the number of insulin injections. Increasing the dose of insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to prvent DKA for this patient as the fundamental issue is missing doses, and the short-term nature of the insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to provide any insulin cover for further omitted doses. Patients with type 1 diabetes can also benefit from DAFNE, a course which helps patients adjust their insulin doses to what they are eating and the patient should be offered this as an educational tool as well to improve control."

What is the most appropriate advise to give regarding steroid dosing for night shifts?\n\n- a) Take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00 regardless of shift patterns\n- b) Adjust to take first dose at waking, then doses at three hours and six hours from starting\n- c) On shift days take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00, but also take an additional 10mg at starting shift\n- d) On shift days take doses at 09:00, but then take second dose at starting shift and third dose six hours into shift\n- e) On shift days omit taking steroids\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nFor patients on steroid replacement when working shift work, doses should be taken from when waking\n\nPatients with Addison's disease need both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Cortisol is highly linked to diurnal rhythm - which is why cortisol naturally peaks in the morning and is at its nadir between midnight and 04:00. Replacement should aim to match the natural rhythm as much as possible; dosing is normally split between three doses, first on waking, then at midday and early afternoon. When a patient shifts their daytime routine, such as working on night shifts or travelling, the patient should be advised to take their morning dose on waking and maintain the timing from there. Patients should not be advised to omit doses, and encouraged to always ensure they are well supplied."

This finished one year ago. Following this, she has retained a clinically and biochemically euthyroid state. She originally presented with weight loss and insomnia, and these symptoms have not re-occurred. Her GP has requested blood tests prior to the appointment which has shown a TSH of 2.6 and a free T4 of 8.2mg/dl. She wanted to have a review as she has recently stopped taking oral contraceptive tablets and is planning to become pregnant. What is the most appropriate plan?\n\n- a) Advise to avoid pregnancy\n- b) Measure serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies\n- c) Arrange for US scan of neck\n- d) Repeat TSH and free T4 in one year's time\n- e) Measure thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nPregnant woman with a history of Grave's disease should have thyroid stimulating hormone binding antibody titres measured even if euthyroid as the antibodies can cross the placental barrier\n\nThis is a patient with a past medical history of Graves' disease who is clinically and biochemically euthyroid who is planning pregnancy. It is important, even with no biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism, to exclude the serum presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies as these can cross the placenta and cause foetal problems. If they were positive, then treatment should be initiated to control the antibody levels, despite the normal TSH and T4. Thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies should be checked in hyperthyroidism at 30-36 weeks gestation to help assess the risk of neonatal thyroid problems. There is no reason she should not become pregnant."

The clinical and biochemical features suggest non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This form is milder, more common, and often diagnosed in later childhood or early adulthood. Usually, women with non-classic CAH present with signs of excess androgens (i.e., excess body hair, early puberty, irregular periods). Hypoaldosteronism (e.g. hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis) can also occur. The biochemical features and low early morning cortisol in this case are highly suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.\n\nDexamethasone suppression test is incorrect. Although Cushing's disease remains within the differential diagnosis, there are no other clinical (e.g. hypertension, proximal myopathy, weight gain, easy bruising) or biochemical features (e.g. hyperglycaemia, hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia) to support this diagnosis. Furthermore, the low early morning cortisol makes this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nKaryotyping is incorrect. Although Turner's syndrome can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.\n\nSerum prolactin is incorrect. Although hyperprolactinaemia can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.\n\nTransvaginal ultrasound is incorrect. Although ovarian tumours can result in androgen excess, this usually results in virilization which is not present in this case. Furthermore, hypoaldosteronism would not be expected to occur with ovarian pathology.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve\n\nA 42-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of neck pain and swelling that worsens upon swallowing. She also reports fatigue, tremors, nervousness, occasional palpitations, and unintentional weight loss. Examination reveals blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and temperature of 37.8 \u00baC. The thyroid gland is tender on palpation and enlarged without any palpable nodules. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\n| TSH     | 0.1 mIU/L ng/mL   | (0.4 - 4.0)   |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Free T4 | 8 ng/dL           | (0.7 - 1.9)   |\n| ESR     | 101 mm/hr         |               |\n\nAnti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies are mildly elevated, while radioactive iodine uptake is low.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Acute infectious thyroiditis\n- b) Graves disease\n- c) Hashimoto thyroiditis\n- d) Solitary toxic nodule\n- e) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nThyrotoxicosis with tender goitre = subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis\n\nSubacute granulomatous thyroiditis , also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, is the correct diagnosis. The patient presents with clinical and biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by tachycardia, tremors, nervousness, low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, palpitations, suppressed TSH, and elevated free T4 levels. These symptoms, in conjunction with an enlarged tender thyroid gland and high ESR level, are indicative of de Quervain's thyroiditis. Typically following a viral infection (not specified in this scenario), this condition is characterised by an initial phase of thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. Management often involves symptomatic relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and betablockers.\n\nAcute infectious thyroiditis , or suppurative thyroiditis, is a rare and potentially serious condition usually seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Gram-positive bacterial infections mainly cause it. Symptoms include sudden-onset fever, chills, malaise, a tender, painful thyroid gland, and signs of hyperthyroidism. In severe cases, the infection causes compression on adjacent structures, leading to dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. It is important to note that de Quervain's thyroiditis has a gradual onset of symptoms and does not cause compression symptoms, making acute infectious thyroiditis less likely.\n\nGraves' disease is not the appropriate diagnosis here. Despite the biochemical and clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, specific anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and a low radioactive iodine uptake are inconsistent with this condition.\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is a relevant differential diagnosis; however, it typically presents with a painless goitre. In de Quervain's thyroiditis, mild elevations in antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies may be observed in fewer than 25% of cases. By contrast, these antibody levels are significantly higher in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\nSolitary toxic nodule is not consistent with this case presentation. Such nodules are generally single, palpable and non-tender associated with thyrotoxicosis. In contrast to this condition, the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and tender with no palpable; the findings align with de Quervain's thyroiditis rather than a solitary toxic nodule."

He has had symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia and lethargy over the past few months, and his fasting glucose is elevated at 7.6 mmol/l. He has no history of diabetes in his family and is currently treated for hypertension and dyslipidaemia by his GP. On examination his blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 70 beats per minute and regular. His body mass index is 34 kg/m\u00b2. Other blood tests of note include GAD+ antibodies, renal function is normal.\n\nWhich of the following is most appropriate with respect to managing his glucose control?\n\n- a) Gliclazide\n- b) Liraglutide\n- c) Metformin\n- d) Sitagliptin\n- e) Basal bolus insulin\n\nCorrect  answer is c.\n\nUp to 10% of patients who are thought to have type 2 diabetes are found to also be GAD autoantibody positive. These individuals are thought to progress faster to insulin start than patients with autoantibody negative type 2 diabetes, (within 3-5 years vs 7 years on average for 'standard' patients).\n\nThe management of these patients is the same as for patients with autoantibody negative disease, metformin as the initial therapy of choice. Weight reduction may delay progression to insulin, therefore insulin sparing strategies, at least during the first few years after diagnosis are the preferred intervention. These may include use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists."

This is because during pregnancy (as early as 4-6 weeks) the amount of thyroglobulin binding protein increases, thus there is less free thyroid hormone in the bloodstream exacerbating this woman's state of hypothyroidism. Increasing the dose of 50 by 50% to 75 is usually sufficient as a measure to induce a state of euthyroid.\n\n25 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would worsen the state of hypothyroidism.\n\nContinue 50 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would not address the issue of the state of hypothyroidism on the current dose.\n\nStop the levothyroxine is incorrect as this would almost certainly exacerbate the state of hypothyroidism yet further.\n\n100 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would be an increase on the dose by 100%; at this stage most likely too much and may cause a state of hyperthyroidism."

The most appropriate medical treatment is propylthiouracil. This has a lower risk of foetal malformation than carbimazole in the first trimester and would, therefore, be first-line treatment. Radioiodine is contra-indicated in pregnancy, whilst propranolol would not address the underlying problem. Surgery can be an option to patients who are resistant to propylthiouracil, and would need to happy at an urgent basis. Of operations, a hemithyroidectomy is more appropriate in trying to obtain histological samples in suspicious histology, whilst a total thyroidectomy would be a definitive management. Urgent treatment is necessary as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies cross the placenta and can cause foetal problems."

ALP is found in bone, liver, kidney, and intestinal and placental tissue, so ALP tends to rise during pregnancy. In pregnant women levels of up to twice that upper limit can still be normal.\n\nAcute cholecystitis would usually present with abdominal symptoms and right upper quadrant tenderness. It is important to bear in mind that the risk of gallstones increases during pregnancy, as oestrogen can lead to higher cholesterol levels in bile.\n\nDiagnosis (according to NICE) can be made based on either a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L or above, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or above. Her fasting plasma glucose is below the threshold.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with itching (particularly in palms and soles) and can lead to complications for both mother and baby if untreated. LFTs are usually deranged but may be normal on some occasions.\n\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is excessive fat build-up in the liver without another clear cause. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated liver enzymes are common in both but would not typically present with just an isolated rise in ALP. There is also no reason for this young fit woman to have NAFLD."

The defect is in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride symporter within the distal convoluted tubules, in contrast to Bartter's syndrome which presents in the same way but with hypercalciuria owing to a defect within the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with both conditions are often asymptomatic or may complain of fatigue, cramps and weakness. Conn's disease is associated with hypertension and in this instance the aldosterone level is normal with an elevated renin, making this diagnosis unlikely. Both Addison's disease and laxative abuse are associated with a metabolic acidosis; in Addison's serum potassium also tends to be elevated. The best answer is, therefore, Gitelman's syndrome."

These patients can be managed initially with oral hypoglycaemic agents, although the \u03b2-cell function may decline over months to a few years, necessitating a relatively early requirement for insulin use.\n\nA 25-year-old woman is referred urgently to the endocrinology clinic. She became pregnant three weeks ago. She had been suffering from diarrhea for the last month, and despite taking the oral contraceptive pill, became pregnant. She went to see her GP who requested blood tests as well as organizing an antenatal referral. Her full blood count, renal profile and liver function tests are all normal, but her TSH is undetectable and her free T4 levels are 52pmol/l. By the time of referral she has also had thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies which are positive. She has no past medical history. What is the most appropriate management for her hyperthyroidism?\n\n- a) Hemithyroidectomy\n- b) Carbimazole\n- c) Propylthiouracil\n- d) Propranolol\n- e) Total thyroidectomy\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nIn pregnant woman who develop hyperthyroidism in the first trimester, propylthiouracil is preferred over carbimazole due to lower risk of foetal malformation\n\nThis patient has a new diagnosis of Graves' disease with positive thyroidstimulating hormone receptor antibodies whilst pregnant in the first trimester. The most appropriate medical treatment is propylthiouracil. This has a lower risk of foetal malformation than carbimazole in the first trimester and would, therefore, be first-line treatment. Radioiodine is contra-indicated in pregnancy, whilst propranolol would not address the underlying problem. Surgery can be an option to patients who are resistant to propylthiouracil, and would need to happy at an urgent basis. Of operations, a hemithyroidectomy is more appropriate in trying to obtain histological samples in suspicious histology, whilst a total thyroidectomy would be a definitive management. Urgent treatment is necessary as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies cross the placenta and can cause foetal problems."

She is normally fit and well and has had one previous pregnancy which was uneventful. A fasting blood glucose is 5.4 mmol/L. Urine dip is negative and her blood pressure is 134/78 mmHg. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Blood results are as follows:\n\n| Hb        | 116 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Platelets | 270 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |\n| WBC       | 7.3 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |\n\n| Na +         | 136 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |\n|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| K +          | 3.9 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |\n| Bicarbonat e | 25 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |\n| Urea         | 6.5 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |\n| Creatinine   | 89 \u00b5mol/L    | (55 - 120)    |\n\n| ALP      | 170 u/L   | (30 - 100)   |\n|----------|-----------|--------------|\n| ALT      | 20 u/L    | (3 - 40)     |\n| \u00ce\u00b3GT     | 55 u/L    | (8 - 60)     |\n| Albumi n | 37 g/L    | (35 - 50)    |\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Acute cholecystitis\n- b) Gestational diabetes\n- c) Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy\n- d) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n- e) Normal pregnancy\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nNormal pregnancy can cause a raised ALP - it doesn't necessarily imply liver problems\n\nThe only abnormal finding is a slightly raised ALP. ALP is found in bone, liver, kidney, and intestinal and placental tissue, so ALP tends to rise during pregnancy. In pregnant women levels of up to twice that upper limit can still be normal.\n\nAcute cholecystitis would usually present with abdominal symptoms and right upper quadrant tenderness. It is important to bear in mind that the risk of gallstones increases during pregnancy, as oestrogen can lead to higher cholesterol levels in bile.\n\nDiagnosis (according to NICE) can be made based on either a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L or above, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or above. Her fasting plasma glucose is below the threshold.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with itching (particularly in palms and soles) and can lead to complications for both mother and baby if untreated. LFTs are usually deranged but may be normal on some occasions.\n\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is excessive fat build-up in the liver without another clear cause. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated liver enzymes are common in both but would not typically present with just an isolated rise in ALP. There is also no reason for this young fit woman to have NAFLD."

She had presented to her GP feeling generally tired for the last few months. Her GP organised a blood screen revealing no abnormalities except the presence of a potassium level of 2.8 mmol/l. Her GP subsequently repeated the test four weeks later revealing a level of 2.6 mmol/l, leading to the referral to the clinic. Other than the tiredness she was well in herself, denying all other symptoms. She denied specifically the presence of any cardiovascular and muscular symptoms and had never collapsed. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she was taking no prescribed medication. There was no family history of note.\n\nExamination revealed a well 27-year-old lady.

The defect is in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride symporter within the distal convoluted tubules, in contrast to Bartter's syndrome which presents in the same way but with hypercalciuria owing to a defect within the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with both conditions are often asymptomatic or may complain of fatigue, cramps and weakness. Conn's disease is associated with hypertension and in this instance the aldosterone level is normal with an elevated renin, making this diagnosis unlikely. Both Addison's disease and laxative abuse are associated with a metabolic acidosis; in Addison's serum potassium also tends to be elevated. The best answer is, therefore, Gitelman's syndrome."

The investigation of choice is thyroid scintigraphy which reveals globally reduced uptake of iodine-131. Most cases are self-limiting and do not require treatment. The other answers provided are not the most common expected findings for De Quervain's thyroiditis.\n\nGlobal normal uptake with uniform uptake of iodine-131 is most associated with a normal thyroid gland. Given the abnormal thyroid function and painful goitre, this would be an unexpected result in this case.\n\nGlobally increased uptake is most commonly associated with Grave's disease.\n\nA well-defined area of decreased uptake would be most consistent with a cold (hypofunctioning) thyroid nodule. This finding would also not be consistent with the painful goitre or hyperthyroidism noted on blood tests in this case.\n\nA well-defined area of increased uptake would be most consistent with a hot (hyperfunctioning) thyroid nodule."

This should be suspected in patients with symptoms of hypoglycaemia that improve after eating. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia can be varied and diagnosis of insulinoma can take months to years due to difficult diagnosis.\n\nInsulinoma is correct. An insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumour that secretes insulin, as a result insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide levels are raised.\n\nExogenous insulin administration is incorrect. Pro-insulin cleavage results in Cpeptide and insulin which are then released from pancreatic beta cells. It is a marker of insulin secretion. C-peptide does not form part of exogenous insulin injections and so would not be raised if insulin was being administered erroneously.\n\nGlimepiride use is incorrect. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea and so can be associated with episodes of hypoglycaemia. It can cause a rise in insulin, Cpeptide, and pro-insulin levels as seen here, however insulin levels would generally not be increased to this degree. To confirm or refute the diagnosis a supervised fast may be appropriate.\n\nAlcohol-related hypoglycaemia is incorrect. Alcohol causes hypoglycaemia by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. In these cases, you would expect to see low levels of insulin and C-peptide in response to low blood glucose levels.\n\nNon-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome is incorrect. This is a rare syndrome characterised by post-prandial hypoglycaemia episodes and a normal 72-hour fast. This is usually due to a genetic mutation and pancreatic hyperplasia. You may expect to see elevated insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide, but the differentiating factor here is that the hypoglycaemic episodes commonly occur after meals which would be unusual in insulinoma."

This patient has acromegaly, which is the consequence of a growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumour. Clinical features include enlargement of hands and feet, coarsening of facial features and frontal bossing. IGF-1 is raised and the diagnosis is confirmed with the failure to suppress growth hormone secretion with an oral glucose load. Trans-sphenoidal surgery is first-line management in most instances. If there are ongoing symptoms postsurgery like there are in this case, there are a number of options. Repeat surgery may be indicated if the residual tumour is accessible. However, it is not in this case. Therefore medical management is indicated to control the symptoms. Octreotide is an analogue of the hypothalamic release-inhibiting hormone, somatostatin. It results in significant tumour shrinkage although the mechanism of action by which it exerts this effect is unknown. It is the first-line medical treatment in this situation.\n\nRadiotherapy is incorrect. This treatment is reserved for cases that are refractory to medical management.\n\nCabergoline is incorrect. This medication was historically used in the medical management of acromegaly. However, it is less effective than octreotide and associated with significant side effects like cardiac fibrosis.\n\nBromocriptine is incorrect. This medication is less effective than octreotide. It is a dopamine agonist like cabergoline and is associated with a similar side effect profile.\n\nPegvisomant is incorrect. This is a second line option in the UK for those patients who do not respond to either surgery, radiotherapy or somatostatin analogues. It is an analogue of human GH and a highly selective GH receptor antagonist which blocks the peripheral synthesis of IGF-1."

Following administration of IV glucose, she recovers quickly.\n\nShe undergoes a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which shows a hypervascular lesion within the pancreas which enhances with contrast.\n\nWhat further finding would be most supportive of the likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Elevated C-peptide following administration of IV insulin\n- b) Low serum C-peptide level\n- c) Normal serum proinsulin level\n- d) Positive anti-GAD antibodies\n- e) Sulphonylurea detectable in urine\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nAn elevated C-peptide level following administration of IV insulin can confirm insulinoma\n\nThe correct answer is elevated C-peptide following administration of IV insulin . IV insulin administration should generally suppress endogenous insulin secretion and therefore C-peptide levels should fall. An inappropriate elevation in C-peptide levels should raise the suspicion of an endogenous source of insulin secretion. The CT findings are suggestive of an insulinoma.\n\nLow serum C-peptide level is incorrect. This would be expected in cases of factitious hypoglycaemia related to insulin administration. While this patient's employment would give her access to insulin and may raise suspicion of this, the CT findings suggest an insulinoma is more likely.\n\nNormal serum proinsulin level is incorrect. This would also be expected in a patient with factitious hypoglycaemia, whether related to insulin or sulphonylurea administration. In an insulinoma, we would expect elevated proinsulin levels, especially after a prolonged fast.\n\nPositive anti-GAD antibodies is incorrect. These would be expected in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the absence of treatment, this would present with hyper- rather than hypoglycaemia.\n\nSulphonylurea detectable in urine is incorrect. In this context, this would be suggestive of factitious hypoglycaemia related to sulphonylurea use. Again, this patient would have access through her employment but the CT findings suggest insulinoma is more likely."

She explains that she has not previously had problems with continence. Her only past medical history include hypertension and angina. Now, she is incontinent of urine only when she laughs or coughs. At times, she reports sudden urges to urinate at all times during the day, resulting in a leak when she is unable to reach the toilet in time. This is significantly impacted on her sleep as well as it is increasingly frequent at night. The patient has reduced her caffeine intake already and has commenced 'bladder training' recommended by her GP. What additional management would you commence?\n\n- a) Pelvic floor exercises only\n- b) Pelvic floor exercises and tolterodine\n- c) Pelvic floor exercises and duloxetine\n- d) Pelvic floor exercises and desmopressin\n- e) Long term urinary catheter\n\n## Correct answer is b.\n\nThe question concentrates on the management of an elderly patient with mixed stress incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome. In the context of mixed urinary incontinence, pharmacological therapies should be offered in addition to conservative therapies such as pelvic floor exercises. A long-term catheter in whom persistent incontinence causes skin wounds, the patient requires such significant care that continuous changing of bed linen and clothes would be required, chronic retention with a risk of renal impairment (and inability to selfcatheterise) or if the patient opts for the catheterisation. The 2013 NICE guidelines recommends first line pharmacological treatment for mixed incontinence or overactive bladder syndrome alone is either tolterodine, oxybutynin or darifenacin1. Duloxetine should only be used if the patient does not tolerate first line therapy and is not a candidate for surgery. Desmopressin can reduce nocturia. However, its effects in platelet activation contradicts its use in ischaemic heart disease.\n\n1. NICE Guideline 171. Urinary incontinence. The management of urinary incontinence in women.

This woman is 30 weeks pregnant and therefore fatigue is not an unexpected complaint. A raised ALP is common in late pregnancy and is usually of placental origin. In the absence of any other signs or symptoms suggesting underlying liver disease, the most likely explanation is that these findings are consistent with normal pregnancy.\n\nHELLP syndrome is incorrect. This stands for haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets. She does not have evidence of either haemolysis or low platelets. While fatigue is a possible symptom, typically other symptoms are also present including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and backache.\n\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is incorrect. This is typically characterized by itch, which is absent in this case.\n\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis is incorrect. While this can cause fatigue and a raised ALP, the median age of diagnosis is 65 and it is relatively uncommon in young people. A placental cause of the raised ALP is far more likely.\n\nAcute fatty liver of pregnancy is incorrect. This is typically characterized by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The ALT level is typically in the 300-500 IU/L range rather than an isolated rise in ALP. The patient will appear unwell, jaundice is common and there may be disseminated intravascular coagulation."

This results in a raised osmolar gap\n\nIdentifying the cause of hyponatraemia can be challenging. The first step is to confirm that it is a true hypotonic hyponatraemia. This is done by measuring the plasma osmolarity.\n\n- \uf0b7 If the measured plasma osmolarity is low this confirms true hypotonic hyponatraemia.\n- \uf0b7 If the plasma osmolarity is normal then this is suggestive of pseudohyponatraemia and should prompt you to measure proteins and lipids, which if present in high levels, can cause a pseudohyponatraemia due to the measuring technique.\n- \uf0b7 If the serum osmolarity is high then this confirms hypertonic hyponatraemia and should prompt you to check for high levels of solutes in the plasma, hyperglycaemia being the most common.\n\nIn this case, the normal measured serum osmolarity suggests pseudohyponatraemia. Pseudohyponatraemia occurs due to a measuring technique defect. Using standard techniques, serum sodium is measured as a ratio of sodium to plasma volume. If the patients plasma has high amounts of proteins or lipids, the plasma volume will be increased resulting in a measured hyponatraemia. This is not a true hyponatraemia as the actual ratio of sodium to plasma fluid will be normal. Common causes include hyperproteinaemia (e.g. TPN, IVIG) and hyperlipidaemia (in particular hypertriglyceridemia).\n\nIn this case, the measured serum osmolarity can be compared with the calculated serum osmolarity. The calculated serum osmolarity = 2Na + 2K + glucose + urea = 273.3 mOsmol/kg. The osmolar gap = measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity = 290 - 273.3 = 16.7 (normal &lt;10). A raised osmolar gap is suggestive of the presence of other osmotically active particles. In this case it is due to the presence of a significantly raised triglyceride level."

The anion gap (AG) is a derived variable primarily used for the evaluation of metabolic acidosis to determine the presence of unmeasured anions. The normal anion gap varies with different assays but is typically 4 to 12 mmol/L.\n\nThe anion gap = (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3) = (136 + 2.5) - (120 + 14) = 4.5.\n\nThus the patient has a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).\n\nCauses of NAGMA include ('ABCD'):\n\n- \uf0b7 Addison's\n- \uf0b7 Bicarbonate loss: GI (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)\n- \uf0b7 Chloride excess\n- \uf0b7 Diuretics (e.g. acetazolamide)\n\nCauses of high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lactate\n- \uf0b7 Toxins (e.g. methanol, paracetamol, propylene glycol)\n- \uf0b7 Ketones\n- \uf0b7 Renal failure\n\nType 1 renal tubular acidosis is correct. The presence of kidney stones, hypokalemia, NAGMA, and a past medical history of Sjogren's favour the diagnosis of type 1 RTA.\n\nAddison's disease is incorrect. Although this can also cause a NAGMA, hyperkalemia would be expected as a consequence of hypoaldosteronism. Furthermore, patients with Addison's will often be hypoglycaemic.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incorrect. Although the patient is significantly hyperglycaemia and likely has undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, the presence of ketones would result in a HAGMA.\n\nType 2 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This can also present with hypokalemia and NAGMA, however, there is not an association with Sjogren's making this a less likely diagnosis.\n\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although diabetes is a cause of type 4 RTA, this condition would be associated with hyperkalemia in contrast to the hypokalemia demonstrated in this case."

An elevated serum IGF-1 level would support the diagnosis of acromegaly.\n\nSerum growth hormone measurement is not the best first-line investigation because GH secretion is pulsatile, with peaks and troughs throughout the day. This can lead to false-negative results if the blood sample is taken during a period when GH levels are low. Serum IGF-1 levels are less variable and provide a more accurate assessment of overall GH activity.\n\nVisual field testing could be useful in assessing potential compression of the optic chiasm by a pituitary tumour causing acromegaly; however, it is not an appropriate first-line diagnostic test for confirming the presence of acromegaly itself. It would be more relevant once biochemical evidence has been obtained to support the diagnosis.\n\nAn oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum glucose may be helpful in evaluating a patient's diabetes status but does not directly address the suspicion of acromegaly. In patients with confirmed acromegaly, an oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone may be used to assess disease activity, as normal individuals should have suppressed GH levels after glucose ingestion, while those with acromegaly will not suppress their GH adequately.\n\nA pituitary MRI could potentially identify a pituitary adenoma as the cause of acromegaly; however, it is not the best first-line investigation. Biochemical confirmation of GH excess should be obtained before performing imaging studies.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of acromegaly has been established through elevated serum IGF-1 levels and/or an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone, a pituitary MRI would then be appropriate to identify the underlying cause and guide further management."

Initially, she tried cyclizine from her general practitioner with little success. You suspect hyperemesis gravidarum. Apart from rehydration and anti-emetics, what also should be prescribed?\n\n- a) Thiamine\n- b) Carbohydrate replacement with 5% dextrose\n- c) Niacin\n- d) Vitamin B1\n- e) Folate\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nNausea and vomiting are both common in pregnancy, affecting 50-80% of pregnant women. Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in 0.3-3% of pregnancies. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and other causes of vomiting should be considered: urinary tract infection, endocrine causes (thyrotoxicosis, diabetic ketoacidosis etc), surgical causes and drugs such as iron supplements.\n\nThe Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) guidelines state: Thiamine supplementation (either oral or intravenous) should be given to all women admitted with prolonged vomiting, especially before administration of dextrose or parenteral nutrition.\n\n(https:www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/green-topguidelines/gtg69-hyperemesis.pdf)\n\nA 5% dextrose intravenous infusion may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. In addition, patients are frequently hyponatraemic and therefore sodium chloride 0.9% is most appropriate (+/- potassium replacement).\n\nFolic acid (400 micrograms) daily is recommended for all women prior to conception and up to the 13th week of pregnancy. Women who are deemed higher risk of spina bifida are advised to take 5mg daily. This is to prevent neural tube defects but has no role in hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is not of clinical concern in this scenario.\n\nNiacin deficiency leads to pellagra. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a self-limiting condition associated with pregnancy and therefore niacin deficiency is not of clinical concern here."

The anion gap (AG) is a derived variable primarily used for the evaluation of metabolic acidosis to determine the presence of unmeasured anions. The normal anion gap varies with different assays but is typically 4 to 12 mmol/L.\n\nThe anion gap = (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3) = (136 + 6.5) - (125 + 12) = 5.5.\n\nThus the patient has a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).\n\nCauses of NAGMA include ('ABCD'):\n\n- \uf0b7 Addison's\n- \uf0b7 Bicarbonate loss: GI (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)\n- \uf0b7 Chloride excess\n- \uf0b7 Diuretics (e.g. acetazolamide)\n\nCauses of high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lactate\n- \uf0b7 Toxins (e.g. methanol, paracetamol, propylene glycol)\n- \uf0b7 Ketones\n- \uf0b7 Renal failure\n\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is correct. The presence of NAGMA, hyperkalemia, and a history of diabetes favours a diagnosis of type 4 renal tubular acidosis.\n\nType 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although this condition also presents with NAGMA, it is associated with hypokalemia.\n\nAddison's disease is incorrect. Addison's can result in NAGMA, with hyperkalemia as a consequence of hypoaldosteronism. However, the presence of hyperglycaemia and hypertension makes this a less likely diagnosis. One would expect hypoglycaemia and hypotension in Addison's.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incorrect. Although the patient is significantly hyperglycaemia, the presence of ketones would result in a HAGMA.\n\nType 2 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This condition is associated with NAGMA and an hypokalemia."

This patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (elevated blood glucose level, acidaemia and ketonemia). A rise in insulin due to exogenous insulin administration causes an intracellular shift of phosphate. There is an element of phosphaturia in addition.\n\nHypercalcaemia is incorrect. This has been noted to occur in the development of DKA, likely secondary to severe metabolic acidosis and insulin deficiency but would therefore be not expected to occur as DKA resolves.\n\nHyperkalaemia is incorrect. Most patients with DKA are potassium deficient and the risk is of hypokalaemia, not hyperkalaemia. Furthermore drives potassium into cells, resulting in hypokalaemia.\n\nHypermagnesemia is incorrect. Insulin administration causes uptake of magnesium into cells and may cause hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia.\n\nHyperphosphataemia is incorrect. It is low rather than high phosphate that is the risk in recovering DKA patients.\n\nA 53 year old gentleman attends his General Practitioner for a 'Well Man Check'.

This often occurs asymptomatically as in this case. In this case it's aetiology is likely secondary to ibuprofen use which has caused an aldesterone resistance in the proximal tubule of the nephron. It is associated with a mild metabolic acidosis and classically presents in patients with a high serum potassium. Urinary pH is commonly normal, but given that the nephron has not lost its hydrogen ion buffering capacity there is scope for the urinary pH to become more acidic to buffer the metabolic acidosis. The serum chloride level is high in this patient, with hyperchloraemia being a cardinal feature of all sub-types of RTA. When calculated, the anion gap in RTA type 4 is normal.\n\nIn NSAID induced nephropathy the urinalysis would show white cells (leukocytes) and may even show proteinuria."

Once you have done that, you will be specifically looking not to miss other coexistent autoimmune conditions they may be trying to hide from you behind a cryptic clinical sign or some subtle blood abnormality. In this example, where she has type 1 diabetes, thinking like that then gives you the diagnosis of an autoimmune hypothyroid cause (Hashimoto's). If you think you have made a diagnosis of Hashimoto's, you should routinely next always look to rule out Addison's, even if the sodium is normal (which it isn't in this example: a subtle blood abnormality). Addison's (just like other autoimmune conditions) may coexist with Hashimoto's. However, the danger of missing Addison's in Hashimoto's is that it sits there masked by the hypothyroid. If you miss it and treat the hypothyroid blindly first without covering the Addison's, you will unmask the Addison's and the patient will come back in an adrenal crisis a few days later."

Observations on presentation to Emergency Department are as follows: respiratory rate 26/min, saturations 94% (on 4 litres oxygen via Venturi), heart rate 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 156/82 mmHg. Auscultation demonstrates crackles at the left base with no wheeze. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is no oedema peripherally.\n\nBlood results on admission are provided below:\n\n| Hb               | 134 g/l        |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Platelets        | 172 * 10 9 /l  |\n| WBC              | 13.3 * 10 9 /l |\n| Na +             | 128 mmol/l     |\n| K +              | 5.1 mmol/l     |\n| Urea             | 13 mmol/l      |\n| Creatinine       | 178 \u00b5mol/l     |\n| Serum osmolality | 220 mosm/kg    |\n\nUrinary sodium\n\n50 mEq//l\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of hyponatraemia?\n\n1. Hypothyroidism\n2. Chronic kidney disease\n3. Addison's disease\n4. Salt-losing nephropathy\n5. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nThis question demonstrates a common scenario in clinical practice. Management of hyponatraemia first requires clarification of fluid status (clinical hypovolaemia, euvolaemia or hypervolaemia), as differentials are influenced by this. This patient's history, examination findings and haemodynamic parameters are consistent with clinical euvolaemia.\n\nDifferentials for euvolaemic hyponatraemia would include hypothyroidism and SiADH. There are no clinical features suggestive of the former. Findings are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia with associated SiADH. This is confirmed by the presence of reduced serum osmolality and high urinary sodium. Measurement of urinary sodium concentration is an useful adjunct in helping to differentiate between hyponatraemia secondary to hypovolaemia and SiADH. With SiADH (and salt-wasting syndrome), the urinary sodium is high. With hypovolaemia, the urinary sodium is typically low."

MRI pituitary\n2. Synacthen test\n3. Thyroid function tests\n4. Toxicology screen\n5. No further investigations required\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nPrimary hypothyroidism can cause hyperprolactinaemia. High leveles of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulate prolactin release\n\nThe patient has galactorrhoea secondary to hyperprolactinaemia. From the history there is not much information to narrow down our differential diagnosis which is currently wide. Hypothyroidism is a very common condition and can cause hyperprolactinaemia. High levels of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) seen in primary hypothyroidism stimulate prolactin release. Hypothyroidism can also cause hyponatraemia as seen in this case. Thyroid function tests are therefore the best answer. A pregnancy test should also be considered.\n\nThe Synacthen test is used to assess for hypoadrenalism. Hypoadrenalism is not linked to hyperprolactinaemia.\n\nCertain drugs can cause hyperprolactinaemia (e.g. dopamine antagonists). However a toxicology screen would not detect these agents."

Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus of 20 years duration, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. Her diabetes is managed with metformin and glimepiride.\n\nHer observations are taken as follows: temperature 37\u00baC, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.\n\nBlood tests are taken, and her finger-stick glucose is 2.7 mmol/L. Glucagon IM and 50 ml of 50% dextrose IV are given. She remains confused, and a repeat fingerstick glucose is 2.9 mmol/L. Serum insulin and C-peptide levels, drawn before dextrose administration, are elevated.\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?\n\n1. Recheck insulin and C-peptide levels\n2. Spiral computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\n3. Repeat glucagon IM\n4. Observe for 30 minutes and recheck finger-stick glucose\n5. Administer octreotide IM\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nIn sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octeotride\n\nThis patient has symptomatic hypoglycaemia and elevated insulin and C-peptide levels, suggesting that the cause of her hypoglycaemia is excessive insulin secretion by her pancreas. Injectable insulins do not have C-peptide. There are two possible causes of excessive endogenous insulin secretion: insulinoma and sulphonylurea overdose. In this patient taking glimepiride, the latter is the more likely cause. In sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite the infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octreotide.\n\nSulphonylurea overdose is treated with bolus dextrose solution. Most patients recover after this intervention. However, since sulphonylureas cause the pancreas to continue releasing insulin, patients are at an increased risk of persistent or recurrent hypoglycaemia. In such patients, 50 to 100 mcg octreotide is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits insulin release from pancreatic beta-islet cells.\n\nRechecking insulin and C-peptide levels is inappropriate in this case and would lead to unnecessary delays in management. This patient with symptomatic hypoglycaemia needs urgent treatment.\n\nWhile insulinoma is a possible cause of raised insulin and C-peptide levels, it is rare and quite unlikely in this patient. Moreover, getting a CT scan would delay the management of her hypoglycaemia.\n\nRepeating glucagon administration may control the hypoglycaemia, but it will not address the underlying cause of persistent hypoglycaemia. The best next step is to administer octreotide.\n\nThis patient has symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the setting of sulphonylurea overdose. Observing for 30 minutes would worsen her hypoglycaemia and may lead to coma or death."

She is a 31-year-old white woman with a BMI (body mass index) of 28.7. In terms of family history, she has a cousin who has type 1 diabetes mellitus and an aunt who is being treated for breast cancer. She has had two previous pregnancies, the first one she, unfortunately, miscarried at 8 weeks, and the second was a normal pregnancy that she took to term with a birth weight of 4.6kg. Neither of these pregnancies was complicated by gestational diabetes, and the baby is now 2 years old and has not had to be taken to see a doctor other than routine appointments.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate testing regime for ruling out gestational diabetes in this woman?\n\n1. Oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks pregnant5\n2. None - as she has no risk factors for gestational diabetes\n3. Oral glucose tolerance test at 12-14 weeks pregnant\n4. Self-monitoring of sugars and repeat appointment in 2 weeks\n5. HBa1c\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nThis question requires knowledge on the risk factors for developing gestational diabetes and appropriate testing based on risk:\n\nRisk factors for gestational diabetes include:\n\n- \uf0b7 BMI &gt;30kg/m\u00b2\n- \uf0b7 Previous delivery of a baby over 4.5kg - which qualifies this patient\n- \uf0b7 Previous gestational diabetes\n- \uf0b7 Family history of diabetes (1st degree relative)\n- \uf0b7 Minority ethnic family origin with a high prevalence of diabetes\n\nIf any one of these risk factors is present then one should offer testing for gestational diabetes. The gold standard testing for patients with risk factors is 2hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation. If the patient has had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy then early-self monitoring of blood glucose or OGTT as soon as possible after booking could also be used for diagnosis.\n\nA diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made if the patient has either:\n\n- \uf0b7 Fasting glucose of 5.6 mmol/L or above OR\n- \uf0b7 A 2-h plasma glucose of 7.8 mmol/L or above"

Her main complaint is recurrent nausea and vomiting. Earlier this year she underwent endoscopy and gastric emptying studies which confirmed gastroparesis. She has since been started on metoclopramide which has had minimal effect on her symptoms. Her weight has decreased by 10% over the past year with a current BMI of 26 kg/m\u00b2.\n\nHer HbA1c today at the clinic is 44 IFCC mmol/l (6.2%) having been 60 IFCC mmol/l (7.6%) this time last year.\n\nHer past medical history includes chronic kidney disease stage 3 and aortic stenosis.\n\nHer current therapy is Humulin M3 22 units at breakfast and dinner, metformin 500mg BD, ramipril 5mg OD, bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg OD, aspirin 75 mg OD.\n\nShe lives alone and is still driving. She denies the need for carers, however, she has had 3 falls in the past month.

The 2 high readings raise the concern of overnight hypoglycaemia with reflex hyperglycaemia in the morning. Her recent weight loss will mean her insulin resistance will have decreased (as reflected in her decreasing HbA1c) and she will require smaller doses of insulin. Changing her insulin from a total of 44 units daily to 30 units daily offers protection against hypoglycaemia. Furthermore altering her split of insulin to the conventional 2/3rd in the morning and 1/3rd in the evening reduces the risk of overnight hypos.\n\nThe risks of tight glycaemic control in this lady vastly outweigh any benefits. She should be advised to check her sugar more regularly for the short-term and given advice regarding driving. Close follow-up with the diabetic nurses should be arranged until her hypo risk is reduced.\n\nThere is no indication for a GLP1 agonist (BMI 26) and metformin should continue (assuming eGFR remains above 30) to allow the reduction in her insulin doses to lowest effective levels."

Her blood tests show macrocytic anaemia and abnormal liver function tests which could be in keeping with alcohol excess. A CT scan showing fatty liver changes adds weight to this assumption. Imaging has not shown any obvious adenoma, ovarian cysts, or gland hypertrophy.\n\nPseudo-Cushing's is the correct answer. Pseudo-Cushing's is also known as 'physiological hypercortisolism'. This can be a result of pregnancy, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic alcohol abuse, depression, and severe physical stress (e.g. infection, surgery). In these cases, there is physiological over-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to these states. It is difficult to differentiate it from Cushing's syndrome. Features of pseudo-Cushing's include; normal or mildly raised serum cortisol, maintained diurnal variation in serum cortisol, a raised urine free cortisol, and a rise in cortisol levels of &gt;170nmol following an insulin stress test. Some Cushing's symptoms such as striae, easy bruising, and proximal myopathy are not usually seen in pseudo-Cushing's.\n\nCushing's disease is a particular type of Cushing's syndrome where a pituitary tumour causes high levels of cortisol due to increased ACTH secretion. This can be differentiated from adrenal Cushing's by checking ACTH levels (these would be high in Cushing's disease), finding a pituitary adenoma on MRI brain, CRH stimulation testing (in Cushing's disease you would see a high ACTH level), and inferior petrosal sinus sampling (high levels of ACTH in these samples compared to serum). In this case, Cushing's disease is not the correct answer as MRI scanning did not show a pituitary lesion, we would also expect to see a higher ACTH level.\n\nCushing's syndrome is a syndrome of cortisol excess. Unlike pseudo-Cushing's, this is not in response to a particular physiological state but is due to an abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In Cushing's syndrome, you would expect to see high serum cortisol and high urine free cortisol, but generally to a higher degree than seen in this case. There would also be a loss of diurnal variation and the rise in cortisol in response to the insulin stress test would be blunted as the sustained hypercortisolism suppressed CRH secretion.\n\nExogenous steroid use is an important differential, good history taking is extremely important. In exogenous steroid use, we would expect to see low ACTH and low cortisol levels.\n\nHypothyroidism may present with the symptoms this patient has, but would not explain the abnormal urine free cortisol."

On discharge, she was keen to know more about obesity and her potential treatment options.\n\nWhich of the following is the best treatment option for her obesity at this stage?\n\n- a) Gastric banding\n- b) Surgical gastric bypass\n- c) Sibutramine\n- d) Lifestyle measures (dietary, exercise, and behavioural interventions)\n- e) Orlistat\n\n## Correct answer is d.\n\nAccording to NICE guidelines, the first-line treatment for obesity is a combination of dietary, exercise, and lifestyle interventions\n\nObesity and being overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Health risks include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, musculoskeletal problems, respiratory problems (obstructive sleep apnoea and asthma), fatty liver, gallstones, and increased risk of some cancers (colon, breast, and endometrial).\n\nAccording to NICE guidelines, the first-line treatment is a combination of dietary, exercise, and behavioural interventions; pharmacological therapy is recommended if there is failure of first-line interventions. Orlistat should only be used when more than 3 months' use of dietary and lifestyle measures has failed.\n\n## Surgery is recommended if:\n\n- \uf0b7 There is a failure of non-surgical measures (no clinically beneficial weight loss over 6 months).\n- \uf0b7 The patient has a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or more, or a BMI of 35-40 kg/m 2 and other significant disease that could be improved if they lost weight.\n- \uf0b7 The patient has a BMI greater than 50 kg/m 2 .\n- \uf0b7 The patient commits to long-term follow-up which needs to be done under the supervision of a specialist obesity team.\n\nA 19-year-old woman presents to her GP with a 7 month history of weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. The diarrhoea is normal colour and over the last three months she has had roughly 2-3 bowel motions per day. The heart palpitations occur randomly throughout the day and night. She has also noticed that she has recently been getting episodes of feeling very hot and sweaty. She has no other past medical history and her only family history is a mother who has Hashimotos thyroiditis.\n\nOn examination, the patient is sweaty and her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse is 102 bpm and regular, respiratory rate is 16/min and her oxygen SATs are 98% on air.\n\nBlood tests are performed and reveal:\n\n| Hb                                | 135 g/l       |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Platelets                         | 220 * 10 9 /l |\n| WBC                               | 7.1 * 10 9 /l |\n| Na +                              | 139 mmol/l    |\n| K +                               | 3.9 mmol/l    |\n| Urea                              | 5.1 mmol/l    |\n| Creatinine                        | 60 \u00b5mol/l     |\n| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 28 pmol/l     |\n| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 0.08 mu/l     |\n\nA thyroid radioisotope scan is performed and reveals a globally reduced uptake.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Graves disease\n\n- b) Thyrotoxicosis factitial\n\n- c) Hashimotos disease\n\n- d) De Quervains thyroiditis\n\n- e) Atrophic thyroiditis\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nThe most like likely diagnosis in this case is thyrotoxicosis factitia. This is evidenced by the reduced thyroid uptake on radioisotope scanning, along with the fact she may have easy access to thyroxine he mother would be taking it for her Hashimotos thyroiditis. De Quervains thyroiditis can present with symptoms similar to factitious thyroiditis and a decreased uptake on radioisotope scan, however, the fact the symptom shave lasted for 7 months makes this diagnosis unlikely."

She reports no other symptoms. Her past medical history includes hypertension and constipation. Her current medications include ramipril, irbesartan, amlodipine and furosemide. No family history is unavailable. On examination, her neck lump is hard, non-tender and measures 2cm by 1 cm, moves with swallowing but not with tongue protrusion. Her heart rate is 84 beats/min and blood pressure 213/130 mmHg. Examination of her joints was unremarkable with no excessive laxity.\n\nHer blood tests are as follows:\n\n| Hb               | 112 g/l       |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Platelets        | 349 * 10 9 /l |\n| WBC              | 7.2 * 10 9 /l |\n| Na +             | 138mmol/l     |\n| K +              | 4.2 mmol/l    |\n| Urea             | 6.9 mmol/l    |\n| Creatinine       | 72 \u00b5mol/l     |\n| Adjusted calcium | 3.1 mmol/l    |\n| Phosphate        | 0.40 mmol/l   |\n\nShe undergoes an outpatient ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of her neck lump.

She develops a mild headache with no visual disturbances, resolving on its own after her blood pressure falls to 182/101 mmHg two hours later. Urinary metanephrine collection was positive.\n\nWhich investigation is likely to produce the underlying diagnosis?\n\n- a) Genetic testing for RET mutation\n- b) Genetic testing for germline VHL mutation\n- c) Genetic testing for NF2 mutation on chromosome\n- d) CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast\n- e) Urinary calcium collection\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nThe clinical collection of phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism should raise suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a, which is a genetic syndrome of near 100% penetrance caused by a mutation of the RET oncogene. The addition of a thyroid lump makes this scenario more suggestive of MEN 2, with medullary thyroid carcinoma completing the diagnosis. MEN2b is subtly differentiated from MEN2a by the lack of hyperparathyroidism and Marfanoid features. Unlikely MEN 1, genetic screening of family members for hyperparathyroidism and germline mutation is useful for long-term surveillance and monitoring. VHL and NF 2 mutations refer to von-Hippel Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 2 respectively: VHL presents classically as a combination of retinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas and phaeochromocytomas while NF2 typically present with intracranial tumours, bilateral Schwannomas almost in all patients."

She denied any heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea, hair or skin changes, palpitations or eye symptoms.\n\nThe patient had a hysterectomy without oophorectomy at age 45 as a treatment for menorrhagia secondary to fibroids. She remembers reaching menarche at around the age of 13 or 14 years. There is no significant family history of coronary artery disease. The patient reported that her mother had suffered a fractured neck of femur at the age of 75 years following a fall. The patient was a retired school teacher with an active lifestyle.

This usually occurs in the setting of thyroid overactivity due to Graves' disease or autonomously functioning thyroid nodules sufficient to suppress pituitary TSH secretion but insufficient to cause an elevation of circulating hormones. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism occurs in 1-3 % of elderly patients per year.\n\nThe main risk of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the increased risk of atrial fibrillation and hip fractures. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends that treatment is considered in patients with a persistently low TSH level if they are older than 65 years or are at risk of osteoporosis or heart disease.\n\nThis patient has a low level of cardiac risk factors with a low-risk lipid profile. Assessment of her osteoporosis risk is complicated by her hysterectomy preventing knowledge of her age at menopause. Therefore, a DEXA scan is appropriate next line management to quantify her osteoporosis risk and inform the decision as to whether or not to treat the sub-clinical hyperthyroidism.\n\nThyroid ultrasound would not influence the decision to treat at this stage and so is not required.\n\nWeetman A.

He takes apixaban, bisoprolol, atorvastatin, and ramipril.\n\nWhat would be the most appropriate course of action regarding his diabetic treatment?\n\n- a) Add in dapagliflozin\n- b) Add in glimepiride\n- c) Add in sitagliptin\n- d) No changes to current medications\n- e) Reduce metformin dose\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nIn patients with T2DM, SGLT-2 should be introduced at any point they develop CVD, a high risk of CVD or chronic heart failure\n\nThe stem describes a patient with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and a background of heart failure. He is also on apixaban for atrial fibrillation and so at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. All patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant high risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic heart failure, or new cardiovascular disease, should be commenced on an SGLT-2 inhibitor once established on metformin if there are no contraindications.\n\nAdd in dapagliflozin is correct. Patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease should be started on an SGLT-2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin.\n\nAdd in glimepiride is incorrect. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, these drugs work by increasing insulin secretion and can be helpful for patients with symptomatic, recurrent hyperglycaemia. It can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.\n\nAdd in sitagliptin is incorrect. Sitagliptin is a DDP-4 inhibitor and can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.\n\nReduce metformin dose is incorrect, the current metformin dose is maintaining a good HbA1c and the patient is not troubled by hypo or hyperglycaemia. There would be no indication to reduce the dose in this case.\n\nNo changes to current medications would be appropriate if this patient had not developed atrial fibrillation. Due to the development of atrial fibrillation, his cardiovascular risk is much increased and as a result, the current best practice is to add in an SGLT-2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin."

He has been feeling well since and has not experienced any new symptoms.\n\nWhich of the following investigations would be most useful for monitoring the effect of his therapy?\n\n- a) MRI pituitary\n- b) Echocardiography\n- c) Growth hormone levels\n- d) Insulin-like growth factor levels\n- e) Oral glucose tolerance test\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nInsulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) have a long half-life and so is a useful measurement to assess growth hormone secretion and therefore screen for acromegaly and monitor the response to therapy. Serum IGF-1 is the most feasible parameter to assess clinical disease activity, in everyday practice in the outpatient clinic setting. It is monitored every 6 months, and growth hormone (GH) levels are done yearly.\n\nNote: Oral glucose tolerance test (plus GH levels) is not helpful for patients receiving somatostatin analogues, and for patients receiving GH receptor antagonist therapy, only IGF-1 should be measured."

He had tripped in a mechanical and had been unable to get back up, lying on the floor for the past 3 days. On examination, he appears extremely dehydrated but has no specific focal weakness, systemic examination is unremarkable. He has sustained no musculoskeletal injuries. His blood tests are as follows:\n\nNa +\n\n168 mmol/l\n\n| K +               | 6.0 mmol/l                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Urea              | 24 mmol/l                                  |\n| Creatinine        | 260 \u00b5mol/l (baseline 107 three months ago) |\n| Creatinine kinase | 11,000 mmol/l                              |\n\nECG shows normal sinus rhythm at 99/ minute.\n\nYou diagnose him with rhabdomyolysis and an acute kidney injury, likely of a prerenal cause. Intravenous fluid rehydration is initiated with intravenous 5% dextrose. You ask your colleague to check the patient's blood tests in 12 hours.\n\nWhat is the aim of correcting the patient's hypernatraemia?\n\n- a) Reduce blood sodium to under 145 mmol/l as quickly as possible\n- b) Reduce blood sodium by 0.5mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 6 mmol/l\n- c) Reduce blood sodium by 1mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 12 mmol/l\n- d) Aim for blood sodium above 145 mmol/l\n- e) Blood sodium does not require monitoring if intravenous fluids is running, CK falling and renal function improving\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nThe correct answer is to reduce blood sodium by 0.5mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 6 mmol/l . In cases of hypernatraemia, it is important to correct the patient's sodium levels gradually to avoid complications such as cerebral oedema and central pontine myelinolysis. Aiming for a reduction rate of 0.5mmol/hr ensures that the correction is slow and controlled, allowing the body to adapt safely.\n\nThe first option, reduce blood sodium to under 145 mmol/l as quickly as possible , is incorrect because rapidly correcting hypernatraemia can lead to severe neurological complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis). It is crucial to correct sodium levels slowly and cautiously.\n\nThe second incorrect option, reduce blood sodium by 1mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 12 mmol/l , suggests a faster rate of correction than recommended. This approach also increases the risk of complications, particularly in elderly patients who may have reduced physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to rapid changes in serum electrolyte concentrations.\n\nThe fourth option, aim for blood sodium above 145 mmol/l , contradicts the goal of treating hypernatraemia. A normal serum sodium level ranges from approximately 135-145 mmol/l; thus, maintaining a level above this range would not address the patient's underlying issue.\n\nFinally, the last option, blood sodium does not require monitoring if intravenous fluids are running, CK falling and renal function improving , is incorrect because regular monitoring of blood sodium levels during treatment for rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury is essential. Monitoring allows clinicians to assess response to therapy, adjust fluid management as needed, and detect potential complications early."

This is additionally supported by the intermittent nature of the symptoms. There are several recognised triggers for 'attacks', including dietary factors such as cheese, tomatoes, and coffee.\n\nBoth alpha-blockers and beta-blockers are used in the management of phaeochromocytoma. Alpha-blockers oppose catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. An alpha-blockade must be performed first with the alphablocker phenoxybenzamine. This medication only has oral forms available and licenced in the BNF and therefore phenoxybenzamine orally is the correct answer. If the beta-receptors are blocked first this leads to a loss of beta-mediated vasodilation and the subsequent unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can precipitate extreme hypertension.\n\nA glyceryl trinitrate intravenous infusion can be used for treating significant hypertension. In phaeochromocytoma, hypertension is primarily driven by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system through the release of catecholamines acting on alpha receptors. Therefore, the most appropriate and effective way to counter this is through an alpha-blocker.\n\nLabetalol is a beta-blocker. Although beta-blockers play a role in the management of phaeochromocytoma, it is important to give alpha-blockers first as mentioned above. Therefore, both labetalol intravenous bolus injection and labetalol intravenous infusion are incorrect.\n\nPhenoxybenzamine intravenous infusion is incorrect, only oral forms of this medication are available and licenced in the BNF."

Urinary metanephrine collection was positive.\n\nWhich investigation is likely to produce the underlying diagnosis?\n\n- a) Genetic testing for RET mutation\n- b) Genetic testing for germline VHL mutation\n- c) Genetic testing for NF2 mutation on chromosome 22\n- d) CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast\n- e) Urinary calcium collection\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nThe clinical collection of phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism should raise suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a, which is a genetic syndrome of near 100% penetrance caused by a mutation of the RET oncogene. The addition of a thyroid lump makes this scenario more suggestive of MEN 2, with medullary thyroid carcinoma completing the diagnosis. MEN2b is subtly differentiated from MEN2a by the lack of hyperparathyroidism and Marfanoid features. Unlikely MEN 1, genetic screening of family members for hyperparathyroidism and germline mutation is useful for long-term surveillance and monitoring. VHL and NF 2 mutations refer to von-Hippel Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 2 respectively: VHL presents classically as a combination of retinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas and phaeochromocytomas while NF2 typically present with intracranial tumours, bilateral Schwannomas almost in all patients."

Of the three, the most common cause is diuretic abuse, especially in young women, and can be ruled out with a urine diuretic assay.\n\nBartter's syndrome presents early in life, with classical features of triangular facies, polyuria, polydipsia and renal failure. Serum renin and aldosterone levels are high despite a low or normal blood pressure. Urine calcium may be raised, and renal stones are a common feature. In Gitelman's syndrome patients may present later on in adulthood, but have a milder disease course or may be asymptomatic compared to patients with Bartter's syndrome. Hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria differentiates Gitelman's syndrome from Bartter's syndrome.\n\nThis patient may need other further investigations such as a TVUS, early morning cortisol and fasting blood glucose tests to rule out other conditions, but in view of her biochemistry profile, a urine diuretic assay would be the most useful next investigation to perform."

This is confirmed by the presence of a pituitary mass of 1.5cm in size that classifies this growth as a macroadenoma. The first-line treatment for all prolactinomas (regardless of size) is the use of dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Dopamine suppresses the production of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland and thus helps improve this patient's symptoms.\n\nDexamethasone is commonly indicated in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or space-occupying lesions. Although this patient has a significant pituitary adenoma, evidence of compression of the optic chiasm and neurological symptoms including headaches, dexamethasone is not first-line in the treatment of prolactinomas. Rather, dopamine agonists are preferred.\n\nDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist and would be contraindicated in this patient given that dopamine suppresses prolactin production and further inhibition could drive the growth of the prolactinoma.\n\nStereotactic radiotherapy is less popular in the treatment of such small lesions, given the risk of damage to adjacent structures and would therefore not be a firstline treatment for this patient.\n\nTrans-sphenoidal surgery is an alternative treatment option for prolactinomas. However, this is reserved if medical treatment with dopamine agonists fails. As dopamine agonists have not yet been initiated for this patient, bromocriptine would be the correct answer."

The physical signs resemble true Cushing's syndrome however the aetiology is idiopathic rather than dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It is therefore important to exclude pseudo-Cushing's prior to further investigation.\n\nThe hallmark of true Cushing's syndrome is lack of diurnal variation in serum cortisol. However in pseudo-Cushing's diurnal variation is normally maintained. Those with pseudo-Cushing's will have elevated 24 hour urinary cortisol and will also fail to suppress serum cortisol with a low dose dexamethasone suppression test. The correct approach in this case is therefore to measure a midnight cortisol prior to proceeding to further investigation.\n\nPapanicolaou DA, Yanovski JA, Cutler GB Jr. A single midnight serum cortisol measurement distinguishes Cushing's syndrome from pseudo-Cushing states.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the first step in management. Raised prolactin can be secondary to blockage of the pituitary stalk with prevention of dopamine reaching the pituitary causing disinhibition of the lactotrophs.\n\nProlactin secreting macroadenomas secrete very high quantities and PRL is usually &gt;6000mU/ml particularly with macro-prolactinomas (this is not the case making a prolactinoma unlikely). Prolactinomas are treated with dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) first-line. Octreotide is used to treat acromegaly.\n\nTranscranial hypophysectomy is done for very large tumours that cant be removed via the trans-sphenoidal route.\n\nA 34-year-old patient is brought by ambulance to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and emotionally unstable personality disorder. She takes metformin and gliclazide. She smokes ten cigarettes daily. She is unemployed.\n\nHer observations are heart rate 111 beats per minute, blood pressure 101/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 21/minute, oxygen saturations 96% on room air and temperature 37\u00baC.\n\nOn examination, her Glasgow coma scale is 9/15 (E1 V3 M5). The cardiorespiratory examination is normal. Abdominal examination is normal. Neurological examination reveals normal tone, downgoing plantars. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.\n\nA bedside blood glucose level is 1.8 mmol/L.\n\nDespite 2 x 100ml boluses of 10% dextrose and a subsequent dextrose infusion, the patient experiences recurrent hypoglycaemia.\n\nWhat is the next most appropriate pharmacological treatment?\n\n- a) Activated charcoal\n- b) Enteral supplementation\n- c) Octreotide\n- d) 10% dextrose\n- e) 50% dextrose\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nIn sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octeotride\n\nOctreotide is correct. This patient has recurrent hypoglycaemia in the context of known sulphonylurea use an emotionally unstable personality disorder. It is likely that she has taken a sulphonylurea overdose. Despite dextrose supplementation, she experiences recurrent hypoglycaemia. Octreotide blocks insulin secretion. The rationale being that dextrose precipitates further insulin release, causing a vicious cycle of insulin secretion. Octreotide prevents further insulin release in sulphonylurea overdose and is an option if the patient remains hypoglycaemic.\n\nActivated charcoal is incorrect. This typically needs to be given within 1-2 hours of administration of sulphonylureas and we do not know the time of ingestion.\n\n10% dextrose is incorrect. Despite sufficient dextrose administration, the patient remains hypoglycaemic and therefore an alternative treatment is needed.\n\nEnteral supplementation is incorrect. The patient has a GCS of 9/15 and therefore enteral supplementation would be inappropriate.\n\n50% dextrose is incorrect. The patient has already had a typically sufficient administration of dextrose. The patient remains hypoglycaemic, likely because of ongoing endogenous secretion of insulin in response to the glucose load and needs alternative treatment that blocks insulin secretion."

The clinical features of primary amenorrhea, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, and groin swellings (suggestive of undescended testes) are suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. The hormonal profile findings of very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH are classical findings of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. The presence of a normal vagina and labia favour complete rather than partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\nKallmann's syndrome is incorrect. Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Cryptorchidism can also occur. However, the biochemical profile, in this case, is not in keeping with Kallmann's syndrome - which would present with low sex hormone levels, and inappropriately low/normal LH, and FSH levels.\n\nMullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Both Mullerian agenesis and androgen insensitivity syndrome can present with primary amenorrhea, shortened vagina, and absent cervix. However, in patients with androgen insensitivity, the gonads are testes, which produce normal androgens. The presence of bilateral groin swellings (indicative of undescended testes) makes Mullerian agenesis a less likely diagnosis.\n\nPartial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is incorrect. The clinical and biochemical features are suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. However the presence of a normal vagina and labia favour complete rather than partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. PAIS results in a spectrum of disorders that ranges from a female phenotype with clitoromegaly and/or minimal posterior labial fusion (Lub syndrome) to genital ambiguity to an unequivocally male phenotype with a minor defect such as isolated hypospadias or azoospermia.\n\nTurner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. However, the biochemical profile, in this case, is not in keeping with Turner's syndrome - which would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels."

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism should be managed with beta blockade as required, and there is no role for thioamides. Pain over the thyroid can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The requirement for T3 and T4 increases during pregnancy, therefore the levothyroxine dose must be increased.\n\nIncrease levothyroxine dose to 200 micrograms once daily immediately : this increase is too high, the patient does not require such an aggressive dosage adjustment.\n\nReduce levothyroxine dose to 75 micrograms once daily : incorrect, levothyroxine dose should not routinely be reduced during pregnancy, the requirement generally increases.\n\nRepeat thyroid function tests at 12 weeks gestation and then consider adjusting levothyroxine dose : this would be inappropriate, thyroid abnormalities should be treated as soon as possible to minimise the risk to the foetus.

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is characterized by the failure of proximal tubular cells to reabsorb bicarbonate, resulting in academia. It is associated with hypokalemia and the development of osteomalacia. The traditional explanation for osteomalacia in this setting is that the proximal tubular conversion of 25 (OH)-cholecalciferol to the active 1,25 (OH)2-cholecalciferol is impaired. Acetazolamide treatment is a known cause of type 2 renal tubular acidosis. This patient presents with aches and pains and proximal myopathy, low vitamin D, low calcium and raised PTH, typical of osteomalacia. Additionally, there is academia (low serum bicarbonate) and hypokalemia. The unifying diagnosis is type 2 renal tubular acidosis secondary to acetazolamide treatment.\n\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is usually associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia.\n\nType 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is less likely to cause osteomalacia and not associated with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use. It is associated with the development of nephrocalcinosis.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. This patient has an appropriately raised parathyroid hormone as a consequence of vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia.\n\nOsteoporosis is incorrect. Calcium is typically normal in this condition and it is characterized by fracture and low T scores, rather than proximal myopathy and generalized aches and pains."

The xerostomia (dry mouth) can lead to difficulty swallowing, particularly foods needing more saliva. The other characteristic feature is xerophthalmia (dry eyes) which can make the eyes feel gritty and uncomfortable. Sjogren's syndrome is associated with type 1 renal tubular acidosis .\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis occurs due to an inability to excrete H+ in the distal tubule. The resulting acidosis is usually accompanied by hypokalaemia. Complications include nephrocalcinosis and renal stones. Causes include idiopathic, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjogren's, amphotericin B toxicity, and analgesic nephropathy.\n\nA sometimes helpful reminder is that type 1 renal tubular acidosis is largely associated with structural/rheumatological problems, whereas, type 2 renal tubular acidosis is associated with metabolic disorders such as Fanconi syndrome, Wilson's disease, and cystinosis.\n\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypoaldosteronism and diabetes, rather than Sjogren's. Type 4 is associated with hyperkalaemia, whilst types 1 and 2 are associated with hypokalaemia.\n\nSjogren's is typically associated with elevated levels of anti-Ro and anti-La. Neither cANCA nor pANCA are typically associated. ANCA antibodies are commonly associated with vasculitides. cANCA (cytoplasmic-ANCA) is associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. pANCA is found in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis."

Therefore it is very important to manage his risk factors. In patients with type 2 diabetes, risk should be assessed using the QRISK2 method. This formula uses cardiovascular risk factors and estimates risk of cardiovascular ischaemia within the next 10 years. If you were to assess this patient, his risk would be far greater than 25%. NICE guidelines advises that if the risk is greater than 10% then Atorvastatin 20mg at night should be started, and increased if the cholesterol does not fall. Starting 80mg of Atorvastatin would be appropriate in secondary prevention, such as following a myocardial infarction. NICE does not advise starting aspirin or clopidogrel as primary prevention unless there is a high risk for an ischaemic event, as determined by QRISK scoring, and the patient is hypertensive or being treated for hypertension. This is because the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is thought to outweigh the benefit of reduction in cardiovascular events in such patients."

The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism. The unifying diagnosis here is MEN type 2A. Up to 100% of patients with MEN type 2A have medullary thyroid cancer at some time in their life and so testing for this is essential.\n\nSerum calcitonin is correct. Alongside a thyroid ultrasound scan, serum calcitonin is required as part of the workup for MEN type II to look for medullary thyroid cancer. Unlike other thyroid cancers, thyroid function tests are usually normal, and presenting features are usually cervical lymphadenopathy or thyroid lumps.\n\nMRI head is incorrect. MEN type 1 is associated with the '3 Ps' - pituitary tumours (most commonly prolactinomas), pancreatic tumours, and parathyroid tumours. In this case, a prolactinoma is unlikely given the normal LH and FSH (prolactin usually suppresses LH and FSH levels) and there are no signs or symptoms of pancreatic tumours and blood glucose levels are normal. MEN type II is more likely. MRI head imaging to look for pituitary tumours is not indicated.\n\nMRI pancreas is incorrect.

When the patient is out of the immediate management stage, feeling better, and able to tolerate oral intake then hydrocortisone can be restarted orally. As this patient has not managed oral intake yet, prescribing oral hydrocortisone may lead to further missed doses. When the patient is having high dose IV hydrocortisone, there is significant mineralocorticoid activity, meaning that fludrocortisone is not needed. She is unlikely to need insulin at all, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with Addison's disease."

The most appropriate intervention is thyroxine supplementation.\n\nThere is no need acutely to stop lithium therapy, although substitution may eventually be considered after discussion with the patient's psychiatrist. Due to the fact that lithium prevents coupling of iodotyrosine, iodine supplementation is ineffective. Prednisolone is also not of value because thyroiditis isn't the cause of the hypothyroidism seen here. Surgical thyroidectomy isn't indicated because there are no symptoms of extrinsic airway obstruction."

Biochemical results which suggest adrenal insufficiency include hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia.\n\nThe short Synacthen test demonstrates failure of cortisol to rise which confirms the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. A normal response is defined as a 30 minute serum cortisol concentration greater than 420 nmol/L.\n\nThe next step is to localise the lesion. This can be achieved by measurement of ACTH or by performing the long Synacthen test. Interpretation of this test is governed by the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 1. In primary adrenal failure: we would not expect there to be a significant rise in cortisol during the long Synacthen rest since the adrenal glands are intrinsically dysfunctional\n- \uf0b7 2. In secondary adrenal failure: chronically low levels of ACTH due to pituitary failure result in atrophy of the adrenal glands. Prolonged stimulation of the adrenal glands by ACTH in the long Synacthen test results in a degree of recovery by the adrenal glands resulting in a significant rise in cortisol. A response that rises gradually to a peak at 24 hours occurs in secondary adrenal failure. This pattern of results also occurs due to prolonged corticosteroid therapy use.\n\nAn important point is to remember that in some cases of long-standing adrenal atrophy due to secondary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands will not respond even after 24 hours and will require several daily doses of depot Synacthen before an adrenal response is seen. The majority of these cases should be identifiable by measurement of plasma ACTH, which would be expected to be very low (in contrast to primary adrenal insufficiency where ACTH levels are very high).\n\nIn this case, the long Synacthen test demonstrates a cortisol which rises gradually to a peak at 24 hours confirming the diagnosis of secondary adrenal failure. The differential is now between iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary disease. The patient is on inhaled steroids for asthma, however this is highly unlikely to cause adrenal insufficiency unless the patient was on a liver enzyme inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole). Therefore the most likely diagnosis is secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nDiscuss (10)Improve"

This is the second most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. While CAH typically presents in the neonatal period, non-classical cases may present later with evidence of precocious puberty, such as in this case. Precocious puberty is when puberty occurs before 9 in males. This patient also has evidence of hypokalemia and hypertension, which can occur in this condition. The elevated serum testosterone but normal LH and FSH suggest a peripheral cause of precocious puberty (in this case adrenal) rather than a central cause.\n\nA brain tumour is incorrect. The LH and FSH are normal. We would expect them to be raised with a central cause of precocious puberty.\n\nHypothyroidism is incorrect. While this can cause precocious puberty, the TSH is within normal limits.\n\nMcCune-Albright syndrome is incorrect. This is a cause of precocious puberty but typically it is associated with cafe-au-lait spots, which are absent here.\n\nLiddle's syndrome is incorrect.

MRI brain\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\nAdrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be used to distinguish between unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia in primary hyperaldosteronism\n\nThe most likely diagnosis here is hyperaldosteronism. Adrenal adenomas and adrenal hyperplasia are the most common causes. Secondary hyperaldosteronism can occur due to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system overactivity as seen in cardiac failure, ascites, and fibromuscular dysplasia. In this case, renin is suppressed, so primary hyperaldosteronism is the most likely answer.\n\nAdrenal venous sampling is the correct answer. This involves sampling blood from the adrenal veins and assessing the levels of aldosterone. This is the goldstandard test to distinguish between unilateral adrenal adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia and should be completed to confirm the location of the abnormality if surgery is to be considered. CT scanning can help identify lesions, however, many adrenal adenomas are non-functioning and not clinically relevant. Hormonal studies via AVS are therefore advised to confirm the location to avoid the removal of an adrenal gland unnecessarily.\n\nDelayed contrast-enhanced CT adrenals is incorrect. Although CT scanning is a good modality to look for adrenal pathology many adrenal adenomas can be too small to pick up on CT. CT can also pick up incidental adenomas that are nonfunctioning and of no clinical consequence. CT is therefore not the most reliable modality to use to confirm the location of the lesion.\n\nFine-needle aspiration adrenal biopsy is incorrect. Adrenal adenomas are usually extremely small and not amenable to biopsy.\n\nMRI adrenals is incorrect. Although MRI can be used, there are similar pitfalls to CT scanning as detailed above - MRI may pick up non-functioning adrenal adenomas or miss small adenomas.\n\nMRI brain is incorrect. Pituitary lesions are not implicated in primary hyperaldosteronism."

Calcium homeostasis is a complicated process involving PTH, vitamin D, albumin and numerous electrolytes. Acquired hypoparathyroidism is the most common form of true hypocalcaemia, most often occurring transiently after thyroid surgery or after the removal of a parathyroid adenoma. Occasionally, hypomagnesaemia can produce hypocalcaemia by decreasing both the body's production of PTH and its sensitivity to the hormone. In this case, it is likely that the patient became magnesium depleted from her course of watery diarrhoea, likely baseline poor nutritional status and alcohol abuse.\n\nChoice 1: Hyperuricaemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Chronic kidney disease, however can lead to hypocalcaemia in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but there is no evidence of renal failure in this patient.\n\nChoice 2: Fluid balance (hyper- or hyponatraemia) does not play a role in calcium homeostasis.\n\nChoice 4: Hypophosphataemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Actually, hypocalcaemia often leads to hyperphosphataemia secondary to increased PTHmediated bone resorption. Elevations in phosphate may also contribute to hypocalcaemia by complexing with circulating calcium and suppressing conversion of 25-OH to 1, 25-OH vitamin D.\n\nChoice 5: Urate levels do not affect calcium homeostasis"

Although Fanconi syndrome can show NAGMA and hypokalemia, you would not expect to acidification of the urine as it is associated with type 2 RTA.\n\nHypoaldosteronism is incorrect.

She had been diagnosed by the emergency department doctors as having community acquired pneumonia after seeing consolidation on her chest Xray and sepsis secondary to this with associated delirium. Collateral history from her partner establishes that she had been feeling unwell for two days with a cough and become increasingly unwell, confused and agitated. The partner also explained that she had recently been diagnosed with an overactive thyroid and been told to start urgently on anti-thyroid tablets, but had not done so when she had read the label of these tablets and found that they should not be taken during pregnancy and she is trying to become pregnant. She had been taking paracetamol only for fever.\n\nDespite treating with IV co-amoxiclav and oral clarithromycin and fluid resuscitation with three liters of fluid as well as IV paracetamol the patient has not improved.\n\nOn examination she is very agitated and aggressive and is difficult to examine. She feels very hot and clammy to touch, but peripheries are well perfused. Auscultation shows left sided crepitations. Her heart rate is 170 bpm, blood pressure 81/40 mmHg, temperature 39.2\u00baC, oxygen saturations 100% on 2L via nasal cannulae.\n\nBlood tests from this admission are still pending. Out-patient blood tests show a undetectable low TSH two weeks ago, as well as a free T4 of 53mmol/ml.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate immediate treatment?\n\n- a. Change to IV meropenem and monitor\n- b. Start carbimazole\n- c. Urgent referral for thyroidectomy\n- d. Start IV propranolol\n- e. IV adenosine\n\nAnswer is D.\n\nIn thyroid storm with IV beta-blockers are a important first-line treatment\n\nThis is a patient with severe confusion, fever and evidence of chest infection and untreated hyperthyroidism. The clinical history suggests that she has developed a thyroid storm as she has fever, severe tachycardia, confusion and agitation with hyperthyroidism. This is a medical emergency, and the most urgent matter is to control her heart rate which is likely the cause for her low blood pressure. IV beta-blocker should be started for this purpose, and propranolol would further help reduce the conversion of T3 into T4. In addition, fluids and dexamethasone should be given, as well as anti-thyroid medications.\n\nChanging to meropenem is unlikely to add any further benefit as the effects of the co-amoxiclav probably have not been seen yet. As the patient is not stable it is not appropriate to refer for surgery as management, but may be a viable longterm strategy to treat her hyperthyroidism. Starting carbimazole now is not the most appropriate action as the patient is unstable and this needs to be corrected first. Adenosine is would be appropriate for a patient with SVT without infection and thyrotoxicosis"

For this reason, if ACTH is undetectable then an adrenal tumour is the most likely cause. In this case, a CT abdomen would be the obvious next step.\n\nNormal 9 am serum cortisol would make a diagnosis of Cushing's less likely, and a raised urinary free cortisol on repeat testing is not specific for the underlying cause. Failure to suppress after overnight dexamethasone suppression test merely confirms a diagnosis of Cushing's. Serum potassium levels as low as 2.4 mmol/l would be very unusual in a case of Cushing's."

His diabetes is currently controlled with a combination of diet and metformin 500mg tds. Looking at his records the last HbA1c was 6.4% (46 mmol/mol). If he decides to fast during Ramadan, what is the most appropriate advice to give regarding his metformin?\n\n- a) Metformin should be stopped\n- b) Metformin 1.5g after sunset\n- c) Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset\n- d) Metformin 500mg after sunset\n- e) Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset\n\nDuring Ramadan, one-third of the normal metformin dose should be taken before sunrise and two-thirds should be taken after sunset\n\nThe correct answer is Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset . This is because during Ramadan, individuals who fast are required to refrain from consuming food and drink from sunrise to sunset. In order to maintain adequate glycaemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia, it is recommended that metformin be taken in a divided dose - a smaller dose before sunrise (predawn meal or Suhoor) and a larger dose after sunset (evening meal or Iftar). This allows for better distribution of the medication throughout the day while still adhering to the fasting requirements.\n\nMetformin should be stopped is incorrect because stopping metformin abruptly may result in poor glycaemic control and increased risk of hyperglycaemia. It is important for patients with diabetes to continue their medications during Ramadan, with appropriate adjustments made under medical supervision.\n\nMetformin 1.5g after sunset is not the best option because taking the entire daily dose at once can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and may not provide optimal glycaemic control throughout the day. Dividing the dose as mentioned earlier helps maintain better blood glucose levels during fasting hours.\n\nMetformin 500mg after sunset is also incorrect because this dosing regimen significantly reduces the total daily dose of metformin compared to his current regimen, which may lead to inadequate glycaemic control. Additionally, it does not account for any pre-dawn medication intake.\n\nFinally, Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset is not ideal as it provides a higher dose before sunrise than necessary. The recommended approach is to take a smaller dose before sunrise and a larger one after sunset in order to minimize potential hypoglycaemia during fasting hours while maintaining adequate glycaemic control"

Addison's disease\n- b. Fanconi syndrome\n- c. Rheumatoid arthritis\n- d. Sjogren's syndrome\n- e. Liver cirrhosis\n\nAnswer is B.\n\nThe patient has a normal anion gap hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis associated with hypokalaemia. This, in combination with the absence of GI symptoms, should alert you to the possibility of underlying renal tubular acidosis.\n\nFanconi syndrome is a disorder of proximal renal tubular function that leads to abnormal loss of bicarbonate, glucose, potassium, phosphate, uric acid and amino acids in the urine. Patients have features of type 2 renal tubular acidosis, accompanied by hypophosphataemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Presenting features include polyuria, polydipsia, osteomalacia (rickets and growth failure in children) and symptoms secondary to the electrolyte abnormalities associated with the disorder. Rifampicin has recently been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and is the most likely cause in this case.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome are causes of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis; a failure of hydrogen ion secretion in the distal tubule that causes hypokalaemia and nephrocalcinosis. The absence of abnormal renal calcification on the patient's x-ray points away from this as the diagnosis.\n\nAddison's disease typically causes hyperkalaemia, often associated with other electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia and hypoglycaemia. It would, therefore, be inconsistent with the biochemistry provided.\n\nLiver cirrhosis does not typically cause renal tubular acidosis unless it is itself a manifestation of Wilson's disease. There is nothing in the question to suggest Wilson's disease as the underlying diagnosis, however, and the occurrence of this pattern of metabolic abnormality would still be predicated on the development of a complicating Fanconi syndrome"

He has signed up for a marathon and is wondering what to do with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for the event. He is normally fit and well without any other medical problems. His diagnosis was established five years ago and since then he has had two admissions due to an inability of taking hydrocortisone and now has emergency doses of IM hydrocortisone. What is the most appropriate advice to give?\n\n- a) Take doses as normal for the marathon\n- b) Double the hydrocortisone dose but not the fludrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- c) Double the fludrocortisone dose but not hydrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- d) Double both the fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- e) Omit both medications for the marathon Answer is B.\n\nA patient with Addisons' disease who undertakes significantly strenuous activity should double the dose of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoids\n\nThis is a patient with Addison's disease who is planning significantly strenuous activity. In such a situation, both fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose should be doubled, with advice to increase fluid intake as well. If the patient was just on hydrocortisone then no additional fludrocortisone would be needed.\n\nGlucocorticoid therapy should ideally mimic endogenous cortisol rhythm with the lowest level at time of falling asleep and highest at waking. Treatment should aim to control symptoms at the smallest dose possible. Hydrocortisone has a short half-life but excellent bioavailibility.\n\nMineralocorticoid therapy will be eventually required in adrenal insufficiency to counter intravascular volume depletion. It is important in the presence of increased fluid loss that the mineralocorticoid dose is adjusted. This is why doubling of the dose is advised.\n\nIf less strenuous activity, such as a long hike, was planned than increasing the dose of hydrocortisone by 5-10mg would be reasonable, without any change in fludrocortisone. This change would also apply for any day that increased activity is planned for. They should also be advised to increase fluid intake in the proportion to the increase in hydrocortisone dose.\n\nIf a patient is taking an alternative steroid regime, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, then endocrinology advise would be needed.\n\nOmitting any medications could be dangerous and precipitate an Addisonian crisis."

Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome display clinical and biochemical features similar to those seen in Cushing's syndrome, such as the scenario here, but the presentation is caused by alcohol abuse, rather than an endogenous source or steroid use. Other causes of pseudoCushing's include severe depression, eating disorders, and chronic illness. Of the options listed above, the insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.\n\nThe high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic sources of Cushing's syndrome. It is not useful in pseudo-Cushing's.\n\nThe low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used as a first-line test for patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome.

Her history includes two previous attacks of renal calculi formation managed conservatively. She had a car crash recently, where she says that the car just 'came out of nowhere'. She is intermittently getting global headaches that can be very severe in nature but are otherwise featureless. On prompting, she tells you that she has sometimes noticed a white nipple discharge on her clothing. She has had low blood pressure and several faints over this last year and after her GP discovered a low serum cortisol level he has started her on oral hydrocortisone and referred her to your clinic. On examination today her blood pressure 130/80. She has a blistering, red rash across her lower abdomen and back. Her abdomen is largely non-tender with no palpable organomegally or peritonism. Visual fields are reduced bitemporally. Her urine dipstick shows glycosuria. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is likely to treat the underlying condition most effectively?\n\n- a) Bisphosphonates\n- b) Surgery\n- c) Cabergoline\n- d) Octreotide\n- e) Insulin\n\nThe unifying diagnosis here is is multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas.\n\nThis patient has symptoms of hypercalcaemia (abdominal groans, renal stones, and psychic moans of the 'bones, stones, groans, psychic moans'). This can be caused by a parathyroid tumour. She has symptoms suggestive of a non- functioning pituitary macro-adenoma causing hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea and galactorrhoea) and hypopituitarism presenting as Addison's from suppressed ACTH. Dopamine is the inhibitor of prolactin in the pituitary, and comes from the hypothalamus. A nonfunctioning pituitary macro-adenoma compresses the pituitary stalk, interrupting dopamine flow to the pituitary, and therefore abolishing dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin, resulting in hyperprolactinaemia. At the same time, the macro-adenoma causes hypopituitarism through local pressure effects on the pituitary itself. 76% of pituitary tumours in MEN1 are prolactinomas, with the remainder being nonfunctioning adenomas. Prolactinomas are extremely sensitive to medical management with e.g. cabergoline or bromocriptine and even shrink in size subsequently. First line treatment for nonfunctioning adenomas however is surgical removal. The gylcosuria is suggestive of hyperglycaemia, which in the context of this MEN picture suggests a glucagonoma.\n\nThe answers try and trick you into looking to manage just one of the abnormalities here in an isolated fashion, e.g. targeting the pituitary with cabergoline, the pancreas with insulin, or the parathyroid with bisphosphonates. This may may happen if you do not recognise that this is MEN. However, as the question asks what treatment is likely to treat the underlying condition, clearly insulin alone, cabergoline alone, or bisphosphonate alone will not suffice. Of the options available, only surgery can tackle all of the problems, and indeed is what most patients with MEN end up needing.\n\nMEN is an autosomal dominant condition. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, anterior pituitary, and pancreas:\n\n- \uf0b7 The parathyroid tumours cause hypercalcaemia and its symptoms (which don't forget include polyuria and polydypsia). The management of hypercalcaemia is fluid resuscitation and bisphosphonates.\n- \uf0b7 Pituitary tumours can be a prolactinoma, somatotroph adenoma (causing acromegally by secreting growth hormone), or an ACTH-secreting tumour\n\ncausing Cushing's disease. There can be any combination of these, although the question will usually point you toward one particular pituitary abnormality. Remember that you are unlikely to elicit a galactorrhoea history unless you specifically ask and are sensitive about it.\n\n- \uf0b7 The pancreas tumours can be an insulinoma (persistent hypoglycaemia -check C-peptide which will be high in endogenous insulin secretion as opposed to exogenously given insulin e.g. in self harm/non-accidental injury, where c-peptide levels remain low. ), gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison, presenting as refractory gastric ulcers), glucagonoma causing persistent hyperglycaemia and also a necrolytic migratory erythema (as in this case), or a VIPoma causing profuse watery diarrhoea (VIP is the antagonist to gastrin and therefore tries to get you to flush the gut out rather than hold and digest contents.\n\nMEN II has two forms. MEN2a presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma (neck lump), parathyroid tumour (hypercalcemia) and pheochromocytoma (hypertension, flushing, tachycardia intermittently). MEN2b presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.\n\nThe key message for the exam is that if you are presented with a case where you suspect there is an endocrine abnormality (even just a high calcium), look again at the stem to make sure you are not missing other endocrine abnormalities being present (e.g. amenorrhoea) that might alert you to there being an underlying diagnosis of MEN. If you know a few key features of each of the possible abnormalities within each type of MEN, you should be able to pinpoint which MEN type is present."

Hypertonic saline (3%)\n- e. Hypotonic saline (0.45%)\n\nIf SIADH is resistant to fluid restriction then the drug demeclocycline can be used\n\nThe differential for hyponatraemia is wide. The fluid status of the patient is of paramount importance for identifying the cause. In this example, the patient is clearly euvolaemic. Causes of euvolaemic hyponatraemia include SIADH, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. The serum and urine osmolarities, and urinary sodium are consistent with either of these diagnoses.\n\nSIADH is effectively a diagnosis of exclusion - primary hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism must be excluded to make the diagnosis.\n\nIn this case, the thyroid function tests are suggestive of euthyroid sick syndrome. This would not be an indication for initiating levothyroxine. Although hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of hyponatraemia euthyroid sick syndrome would not effect sodium balance. It is often stated that to make a diagnosis of SIADH relies upon 'normal thyroid function tests'. It is important to note that this is referring to primary hypothyroidism. Euthyroid sick syndrome does not preclude the diagnosis of SIADH.\n\nThe morning cortisol is normal which suggests that hypoadrenalism is not present.\n\nTherefore the most likely diagnosis is SIADH secondary to a chest infection. The initial treatment for non-severe SIADH is fluid restriction.\n\nThis patient has been trialled with fluid restriction however the sodium has not improved and has in fact got worse. The next step in the management would be demeclocycline. Demeclocycline inhibits the effects of ADH on the renal tubules. It effectively causes a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant use of hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline has risks associated with it, as rapid correction of serum Na can result in central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nIf the patient had been hypervolaemic then furosemide would be indicated"

She has tested positive for the RET oncogene and is concerned as her mother had suffered from thyroid cancer. However, she is reluctant to undergo a prophylactic thyroidectomy and asked if there is another option available.\n\nWhich of the following management options would be appropriate for her case?\n\n- a) Annual monitoring of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)\n- b) Annual monitoring of thyroglobulin\n- c) Annual 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels (5-HIAA)\n- d) Annual monitoring of calcitonin\n- e) Annual monitoring of chromogranin A Answer is D.\n\nCalcitonin can be used as a marker to monitor for Medullary thyroid carcinoma in MEN type II in those unwilling to undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy\n\nCalcitonin is a marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma which is associated with MEN type II.\n\nChromogranin A and 5-HIAA can be used as markers for neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome respectively.\n\nThyroid peroxidase antibody titre can be used as a marker in autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves disease.\n\nThyroglobulin can be used as a marker for papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. For example, a rise in this marker following a thyroidectomy can indicate the recurrence of these particular cancers"

His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. He usually takes metformin 500 mg three times daily, gliclazide 80 mg twice daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg nightly. On examination he is confused with dry mucous membranes, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, a pulse of 110/min, a temperature of 37.6 oC and a respiratory rate of 20/min. Course crepitations were found at the right base and his pulse was thready with a capillary refill of 3 seconds; jugular venous pressure was not visible. Capillary blood glucose was found to be HI.\n\n## A venous blood sample is taken:\n\n| Hb         | 129 g/l        | Na +       | 161 mmol/l   |\n|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Platelet s | 204 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 4.9 mmol/l   |\n| WBC        | 13.1 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 15.2 mmol/l  |\n| Neuts      | 11.9 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine | 97 \u00b5mol/l    |\n| Glucose    | 56 mmol/l      | eGFR       | 62 mg/l      |\n| Ketones    | 1.9 mmol/l     | HbA1c      | 75 mmol/mol  |\n| pH         | 7.35           | HCO3       | 20 mmol/mol  |\n\nWhat treatment would you initiate first?\n\n- a. 0.9% normal saline\n- b. 0.45 % normal saline\n- c. Hartmann's solution\n- d. Intravenous insulin\n- e. 5% dextrose\n\n## Answer is A.\n\nThe underlying diagnosis is hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) precipitated by a lower respiratory tract infection. The diagnosis is made when a patient shows marked hyperglycaemia and hypovolaemia with a serum osmolality &gt; 320 mosm/kg in the absence of marked ketonaemia or acidosis. This patient is clinically dry with a glucose of 56 and a calculated osmolality of 2(161+4.9) + 56 + 15 = 403 mosm/kg with mild ketonaemia.\n\nDespite this gentlemen's hypernatraemia, the first line fluid therapy is 0.9% normal saline as patients in HHS are sodium deplete. One litre should be administered rapidly and electrolytes then repeated to gauge potassium requirements in further fluid bags. A small initial rise in sodium is expected and this should not discourage further use of normal saline. Insulin is not routinely started immediately in the absence of significant ketonaemia as glucose will fall with fluid therapy alone. When glucose stops falling insulin may be started if glucose still remains high. Too rapid correction of osmolality i.e. with aggressive insulin and fluids in combination can precipitate cerebral oedema."

On examination, you note a lack of testicle development and sparse axillary and pubic hair.\n\n## Blood results are as follows:\n\n| Testosteron e   | 2 nmol/L   | (6 -27)      |\n|-----------------|------------|--------------|\n| FSH             | 4.6 IU/L   | (1.8 - 22.5) |\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n- b) Kallmann's syndrome\n- c) Klinefelter syndrome\n- d) Mullerian agenesis\n- e) Turner's syndrome\n\nKallman's syndrome - LH &amp; FSH low-normal and testosterone is low\n\nKallmann's syndrome is correct. Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The biochemical profile is in keeping with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to the presence of low testosterone and inappropriately normal LH and FSH. Kallmann's syndrome is the only listed condition which results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is correct. Androgen insensitivity syndrome in its complete form is a disorder of hormone resistance characterised by a female phenotype in a genetic male due to the resistance to the effector functions of testosterone. The hormonal profile findings include very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH. Thus the patient's phenotypical sex and hormonal profile exclude this diagnosis.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is incorrect. Klinefelter syndrome is an aneuploid genetic condition where a male has an additional copy of the X chromosome. The primary features are infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles. This condition results in primary gonadal failure, and thus a compensatory elevation in LH and FSH.\n\nMullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Given that the patient is phenotypically male, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\nTurner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. This would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels. It only affects females. Thus the patient's phenotypic sex, and biochemical results are not in keeping with this diagnosis."

She has no past medical history and does not take any medications.\n\nOn examination, there is no axillary or pubic hair. There are swellings palpable in the groins bilaterally. There is normal breast development.\n\n\n\nWhat is the likely diagnosis?\n\n- a. 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency\n- b. Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n- c. Klinefelter syndrome\n- d. Pituitary tumour\n- e. Turner syndrome\n\nPrimary amenorrhoea, little or no axillary and pubic hair, elevated testosterone \u2192 androgen insensitivity syndrome\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is the correct answer. This is an X-linked recessive condition caused by end-organ resistance to testosterone causing genotypically male children (46XY) to have a female phenotype. Patients often present with primary amenorrhoea along with absent pubic/axillary hair. Bilateral groin swellings may reflect undescended testes and breast development may occur as a result of the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol. Testosterone is typically in the upper normal range for a post-pubertal male.\n\n17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is incorrect. This is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that may also present with primary amenorrhoea and external female genitalia. However, in this condition, testosterone will be low as a lack of androgens are characteristic of this disease.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is incorrect. This is a syndrome where a patient that is phenotypically male has an extra X chromosome (i.e. 47 XXY). Patients may have small testicles and infertility as predominant features. The patient in this scenario is phenotypically female.\n\nPituitary tumour is incorrect. This may cause delayed puberty if it causes impaired secretion of gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) i.e. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, breast development may also be impaired with a pituitary tumour and testosterone will be in the normal range for a female, in contrast to this case where it is in the high-normal range for a male.\n\nTurner syndrome is incorrect. This can cause primary amenorrhoea as a consequence of primary ovarian insufficiency. Breast development will be abnormal but pubic and axillary hair development will typically be normal. Unlike this case, testosterone will be in the normal range for a female. Patients have a 45XO karyotype"

Apart from adjusting the insulin dose, what is the most appropriate action?\n\n- a) Advise the patient to inform the DVLA and to not drive\n- b) The consultant should inform the DVLA\n- c) Advise the patient to start checking blood glucose prior to driving\n- d) Advise the patient to always carry a snack when driving\n- e) Advise the patient to attend retinal screening prior to driving again\n\nPatient with diabetes who have had two hypoglycaemic episodes requiring help needs to surrender their driving licence\n\nThis patient has had hypoglycaemic episodes needing help multiple times. If a patient needs help to correct the hypoglycaemic episode then it is termed severe hypoglycaemia and is of concern to the DVLA. If a patient has two or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia then they need to inform the DVLA and not drive.\n\nPatients who take insulin should have their licence for driving assessed on an annual basis. For this they will be required to submit three months of blood glucose readings. Patients are advised to always check blood glucose before driving and to always have a snack in their vehicle as well, not just if having hypoglycaemic episodes.\n\nWhen the DVLA is informed, the patient should be advised to inform the DVLA themselves rather than breaking patient confidentiality, but if the patient repeatedly fails to follow this advise then the doctor should inform the DVLA after telling the patient that he or she is doing so"

He was started on hydrocortisone for Addison's disease six months ago following a history of feeling generally unwell, postural dizziness and vomiting. Following starting hydrocortisone he felt much better. He was originally started on 10mg in the morning and 5mg at lunchtime and 5mg in the early afternoon. This was further increased to 10mg, 10mg and 5mg for the morning, lunchtime, and afternoon, respectively. The patient feels that all of the original symptoms have resolved, but he has noticed swelling of his ankles. On examination, he has non-pitting oedema of his legs. He has a heart rate of 78bpm, blood pressure of 165/102mmHg, saturations of 98% on room air and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His previous blood pressure recorded in clinic had been 105/61mmHg He has no other medical problems, and takes no other tablets apart from paracetamol and ibuprofen when needed, especially for headaches. What is the most appropriate action?\n\n- a. Start amlodipine\n- b. Start ACE inhibitor\n- c. Reduce dose of hydrocortisone\n- d. Increase dose of hydrocortisone\n- e. Start beta-blocker\n\nCorrect answer is c\n\nFeatures of over-replacement of corticosteroids require dose adjustment\n\nThis is a patient on treatment for Addison's disease who has developed evidence of over-replacement. These features can be any of Cushing's disease; such as hypertension for this patient. The increase in blood pressure with steroids implies that this is not essential hypertension but rather secondary hypertension. This implies that he is having a too much steroid replacement and hydrocortisone dose should be reduced. Features of over-replacement include hypertension, thin skin, striae, easy bruising, hyperglycaemia and electrolyte abnormalities. Features of under-replacement include fatigue, postural hypotension, weight loss and salt craving\n\nA 28-year-old woman has presented with a 5 month history of weight loss (despite an increase in appetite), tremor, loose bowels, and heat intolerance. She has otherwise been well and her only significant family history is that her brother has alopecia areata. She tells you that she had a positive pregnancy test last week and is awaiting her booking appointment. On examination, she appears anxious and her heart rate is 105 beats/minute. She has a tremor when her arms are outstretched and her eyes appear large. She also has a goitre. The rest of her examination is unremarkable. Her blood results find hyperthyroidism. Which of the following medications are most suited to treat her hyperthyroidism?\n\n- a) Propylthiouracil\n- b) Carbimazole\n- c) Radioactive iodine\n- d) Carbimazole and Levothyroxine\n- e) Levothyroxine answer is A\n\nDuring early pregnancy, propylthiouracil should be used.

    "block": "## Question #275\n\nA 50-year-old woman is reviewed in your follow-up endocrinology clinic. She was referred one year ago by her GP, having noticed a nodule in the front of her neck. Before noticing this nodule, she had suffered from a 6-month history of worsening diarrhoea, and occasional flushing. She was found to have a mutation of the RET proto-oncogene and underwent a thyroidectomy, followed by external beam radiotherapy. Her only current medication is levothyroxine.\n\nWhich of the following is the most useful test in monitoring for recurrence of this woman's disease?\n\n- a. Alfa fetoprotein\n- b. Calcitonin\n- c. Thyroglobulin\n- d. Thyroid stimulating hormone\n- e. Thyroxine\n\n## Answer is B\n\nMedullary thyroid cancer - calcitonin is used for screening, prognosis and monitoring\n\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma originates from the C cells, or parafollicular cells, which secrete calcitonin. It makes up approximately 5% of thyroid cancers. It may be sporadic, but in 25% of cases, it is associated with RET oncogene, as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Despite testing positive for RET oncogene it is possible that other features of MEN2, such as hyperparathyroidism or phaeochromocytoma, do not manifest. Such is the case with this woman.\n\nAlso, note that radioiodine was not used in the treatment of her disease. Unlike other thyroid cancers, it is of little benefit in medullary thyroid cancer. Her symptoms of flushing and diarrhoea, are typical of medullary cancer and are caused by calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Papillary and follicular cancers are more commonly asymptomatic.\n\nCalcitonin is used for screening, prognosis and monitoring in medullary thyroid cancer. CEA is often used in conjunction with calcitonin but is not an option here.\n\nThyroglobulin is used in monitoring follicular thyroid cancer.\n\nThyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are both typically normal in thyroid cancer. This woman has had her thyroid gland removed, and is taking levothyroxine. As such, she would likely be having her TSH monitored. Unlike in other thyroid cancers, TSH suppression is not appropriate for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer and so thyroxine replacement is monitored similarly to that of hypothyroidism, with a target TSH within the normal range. Her TSH may be monitored, but not to detect recurrence of medullary thyroid cancer.\n\nAlfa fetoprotein is not of use in monitoring thyroid cancer."

This woman presents with painful swelling in her neck (a likely goitre in the context of hyperthyroidism) post-coryzal illness with raised inflammatory markers (CRP), in association with globally reduced uptake of iodine-131. These findings are consistent with viral sub-acute thyroiditis.\n\nFactitious hyperthyroidism is incorrect. Although she has a history of depression (and this is a risk factor for thyroid hormone misuse), this would not explain the raised CRP or neck pain.\n\nGrave's disease is incorrect. This is associated with increased uptake of iodine-131 on a radioactive iodine scan.\n\nLithium associated thyroiditis is incorrect. This is classically 'painless' thyroiditis.\n\nPost-partum thyroiditis is incorrect. While she is post-partum and this is a plausible differential, this condition is not associated with neck pain or raised inflammatory markers, making this diagnosis unlikely."

Decrease levothyroxine to 50mcg od\n- b. Keep levothyroxine at 75mcg od\n- c. Increase levothyroxine to 100mcg od\n- d. Keep levothyroxine at 75mcg od + increase folic acid to 5mg od\n- e. Stop levothyroxine until TSH known\n\nAnswer is C\n\nPregnant with hypothyroidism \u2192 immediately increase levothyroxine and monitor TSH closely\n\nThe correct answer is to increase levothyroxine to 100mcg od . In pregnant women with hypothyroidism, it is essential to maintain adequate thyroid hormone levels for the developing fetus. The requirement for levothyroxine often increases during pregnancy due to increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and placental degradation of maternal T4. According to UK guidelines, pregnant women with pre-existing hypothyroidism should have their levothyroxine dose increased by approximately 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, even before obtaining repeat TSH and free T4 measurements. This ensures that both mother and baby have sufficient thyroid hormone levels during the critical early stages of fetal development.\n\nThe option to decrease levothyroxine to 50mcg od would not be appropriate, as reducing the dose could lead to inadequate thyroid hormone levels in the mother and potentially harm fetal development.\n\nKeeping the levothyroxine at 75mcg od might seem reasonable if her TSH was well-controlled prior to pregnancy; however, this does not account for the increased requirements during pregnancy. It would be safer and more appropriate to increase the dose proactively.\n\nAs for keeping levothyroxine at 75mcg od + increasing folic acid to 5mg od , while it is important for pregnant women to take folic acid supplements, increasing the dose of folic acid alone without adjusting the levothyroxine dosage does not address her increased thyroid hormone needs during pregnancy.\n\nFinally, choosing to stop levothyroxine until TSH is known would put both mother and fetus at risk of complications related to untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism. It is crucial that patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism continue their levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy, with appropriate dose adjustments as needed."

High levels of these hormones results in suppression of LH and FSH. During pregnancy, prolactin levels also increase. Prolactin causes enlargement of the mammary glands and prepares for milk production."

He is previously fit and well, does not smoke and drinks alcohol only occasionally. He had fallen the previous night and suffered a distal radius fracture and has just undergone a open reduction and internal fixation under general anaesthetic. During anaesthesia he received 4mg ondansetron and 8mg dexamethasone for post-operative nausea and 10mg morphine for pain. He denies feeling unwell and has no symptoms suggestive of intercurrent infection.\n\nOn examination his heart rate is 130 beats/min and irregular, his blood pressure is 135/74 mmHg and his temperature is 39.4\u00baC.

Crystalloid infusion\n6. answer is C\n\nThe diagnosis here is thyrotoxicosis as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism. Infection is unlikely given the normal clinical examination and normal CRP. During initial treatment of thyrotoxicosis it is important to treat hypoadrenalism first - if present - in order to not precipitate a addisonian crisis. However, this patient has no features in the history to suggest pre-existing Addisons disease, he has normal electrolytes and the suppressed cortisol can be explained by the peri-operative use of dexamethasone. Initial treatment of thyrotoxicosis should focus on sympathetic storm suppression using beta blockade. Anti-thyroid medications i.e. carbimazole - take up to six weeks to take full effect and are not useful in the acute scenario."

He is extremely tearful and anxious. He is worried about losing his livelihood as a result of his diabetes.\n\nHe was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 9 years ago and became insulin dependent 2 years ago. He reports good compliance with insulin every day. However, 18 months ago, he took the same units of insulin after exercising and felt giddy. A spot blood glucose check demonstrated 2.8 mmol/l, which improved immediately after drinking Lucozade that he carried with him. No hospitalisation was required. He has no other past medical history. He has no visual field or peripheral nerve impairments. What is the advice you give him regarding driving?\n\n- a. Can continue driving, review in 1 year\n- b. Can continue driving, no further reviews required\n- c. Must stop driving and give up license permanently\n- d. Must stop driving temporarily and review in 6 months\n- e. Patient can drive type 1 vehicles (cars, motorcycles) but not type 2 vehicles (lorries, HGV) and should reconsider his profession\n\n## Answer is A\n\nThe salient points in this case history are that the patient, although insulin dependent for treating his type 2 diabetes, retains hypoglycaemia awareness. A recent change in the DVLA guidelines of May 2012 allows HGV drivers to retain their license even if taking insulin, provided they have not suffered from hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of others within the past 12 months, and the patient has no visual field impairments. The patient must then be reviewed annually by a diabetes consultant, with 3 months of blood glucose monitoring data available. A 1-year license is then issued annually."

He has a history of hypertension which remains uncontrolled despite compliance with medications, a low-salt diet, and regular exercise.\n\nHis observations are taken as follows: temperature is 36.7\u00baC, blood pressure 146/98mmHg, heart rate 90/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. On examination, facial features appear coarse and differ significantly from those on his driver's license photograph taken 3 years ago. His fingers are swollen, and his skin appears to have thickened.\n\nHis IGF-1 levels are raised, and an MRI shows a pituitary adenoma. The patient undergoes trans-sphenoidal surgery for the resection of his tumour.\n\nOn follow-up 3 months later, his serum IGF-1 levels are still raised. He still has the same symptoms as before. He is referred for a repeat MRI that shows no residual tumour.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\n\n- a) Refer for stereotactic radiotherapy\n- b) Repeat transsphenoidal surger\n- c) Start octreotide\n- d) Repeat IGF-1 levels in 12 weeks\n- e) Repeat IGF-1 levels in six months\n\n## Answer is C\n\nAcromegaly: if patients are not suitable for trans-sphenoidal surgery, or have residual symptoms, then octreotide may be used\n\nThis patient's facial changes over time, coarse facial features on examination and elevated IGF-1 levels point towards a diagnosis of acromegaly. Since his MRI showed a pituitary adenoma, he was treated with transsphenoidal surgery. However, he remains symptomatic, and his IGF-1 levels have not reduced even after 3 months. Patients with residual symptoms need to repeat transsphenoidal surgery or start medical therapy with octreotide.\n\nSince this patient has no residual tumour on his repeat MRI, he is not a candidate for repeat transsphenoidal surgery. Therefore, the most appropriate step for this patient is to start medical therapy with octreotide. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. It tends to decrease the size of the adenoma and its secretion of growth hormone.\n\nStereotactic radiotherapy is recommended for patients who fail medical therapy and is therefore not the best next step in the management of this patient.\n\nRepeating IGF-1 levels again in 12 weeks is inappropriate as the IGF-1 level should have normalised at this follow-up 12 weeks after the transsphenoidal surgery. His repeat IGF-1 levels at 12 weeks are raised. He requires further medical or surgical management instead of follow-up in 12 weeks.\n\nPatients with normal IGF-1 levels on a 12-week follow-up should have repeat IGF-1 levels at six months and then, annually."

Beer potomania\n- b. Cerebral salt wasting\n- c. Diabetes insipidus\n- d. Primary polydipsia\n- e. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH)\n\nSIADH criteria includes Na &lt; 135, serum osmolality &lt;271 and urinary osmolality &gt;100 in a euvolaemic patient\n\nThe patient has significant hyponatraemia. Since the serum osmolarity is &lt; 275 we have confirmed a true hypotonic state.\n\nIn contrast, if the serum osmolarity was normal (275-295) then this would imply isotonic hyponatremia (i.e. pseudohyponatraemia). This is a measuring defect which can occur due to high levels of lipids (e.g. triglycerides) or proteins (e.g. macroglobulinaemia). These macromolecules take up a proportion of plasma volume thereby resulting in a spurious hyponatremia (as the lab measures Na / plasma volume rather than Na / plasma fluid).\n\nIf the serum osmolarity is &gt; 295 then this implies a hypertonic hyponatremia. This occurs due to high levels of osmotically active solutes (e.g. hyperglycaemia or mannitol). This results in an osmotic shift of fluid into the extracellular space resulting in dilutional hyponatremia.\n\nIn this clinical case, we are dealing with a true hypotonic hyponatremia. The causes of this are wide but can broadly be divided into:\n\n- \uf0b7 Too much fluid (e.g. decreased output or increased intake)\n- \uf0b7 Too little sodium (e.g. decreased intake or increased output)\n- \uf0b7 Can also be due to a combination e.g. sodium and water loss (with sodium loss &gt; water loss)\n\nIt is therefore absolutely essential to assess the fluid status of the patient to help identify the cause.\n\nUrinary sodium is an exceptionally useful tool, and indeed after clinical examination, this is the most useful investigation. In hyponatremia, we would expect low urinary sodium as a physiological response to conserve sodium. Therefore urinary sodium &gt;10 is suggestive of renal sodium loss (e.g. CKD, diuretics, hypoaldosteronism, and salt-losing nephropathy). Other causes of high urinary sodium include endocrine disease (e.g. Addison's), primary polydipsia, and SIADH. In SIADH, an initial hypervolaemic state results in aldosterone suppression resulting in natriuresis and high urinary sodium. In secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, nephrotic syndrome) we get increased sodium retention and therefore low urinary sodium.\n\nIt is extremely important to note that urine osmolarities and electrolytes must be interpreted with caution. Urinary sodium will be high after taking diuretics, but may go very low after their effects wear off, particularly if the patient is dehydrated.\n\nThe urine osmolarity is often not particularly helpful. In the presence of hyponatremia, the body's natural response to raise sodium would be to increase free water output resulting in a high urinary output with low urine osmolarity. Therefore urine osmolarity helps to differentiate between conditions associated with impaired free water excretion (high urine osmolarity &gt;100), as seen in the majority of cases, and a few conditions associated with low urine osmolarity &lt;100.\n\nThe urine osmolarity will be raised (&gt;100) in the majority of cases either due to inappropriate ADH release (e.g. SIADH), appropriate ADH release (hypovolaemia) or pseudo 'appropriate' ADH release (perceived intravascular depletion but actual hypervolaemic states e.g. nephrotic syndrome, heart failure and cirrhosis). However, if it is low (&lt;100) then this suggests psychogenic polydipsia or beer drinker's protomania.\n\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH) is correct. The patient fulfils the diagnostic criteria of SIADH making this the most likely diagnosis. Importantly he fulfils the biochemical criteria, has normal thyroid and adrenal function, is euvolemic, and is not on diuretics which may confound the biochemical analysis.\n\nBeer potomania is incorrect. Potomania is a specific hypo-osmolality syndrome related to the massive consumption of beer, which is poor in solutes and electrolytes. In this condition, one would expect the urine osmolarity to be &lt;100 since free water excretion is not impaired in this condition.\n\nCerebral salt wasting is incorrect. Both cerebral salt wasting and SIADH are characterised by hyponatremia with elevated urinary sodium and concentrated urine. The key distinguishing factor is that in cerebral salt wasting the patient is hypovolemic whereas SIADH patients are euvolaemic.\n\nDiabetes insipidus is incorrect. The fact that the patient is on lithium is a red herring. Lithium is a well-known cause of diabetes insipidus (DI), however, DI is essentially the opposite condition to SIADH. In DI we have a failure of ADH to act on the kidneys resulting in polyuria, dehydration, raised serum osmolarity and hypernatraemia,\n\nPrimary polydipsia is incorrect. In this condition, one would expect the urine osmolarity to be &lt;100 since free water excretion is not impaired."

An initial bolus of insulin is not advised due to a randomised controlled trial that found no benefit. Fixed rate insulin infusions are now preferred over titration of insulin dose against blood sugar levels (sliding scale). This is due to the fact that blood glucose may correct more quickly than ketoacidosis and so ensures adequate insulin to eradicate ketones.\n\nThere is no consensus between expert bodies as to biochemical end-point of DKA, therefore it is advised that patients are transferred onto subcutaneous insulin once they are eating and drinking normally. It is vital to ensure an overlap between the administration of intravenous and subcutaneous insulin to avoid recurrent ketogenesis.\n\nMisra S, Oliver N. Diabetic ketoacidosis in adults.

Although often associated with pelvic floor damage for example during childbirth, it can also present as a result of age-related changes. The first-line management for stress incontinence is pelvic floor muscle training which is the correct answer here.\n\nBladder retraining is useful in cases of urge incontinence however this patient denies any history of urinary urgency. Urge incontinence occurs due to an overactive bladder. Bladder retraining aims to regain control over the function of the bladder. As stress incontinence is related to weakened pelvic floor muscles, bladder retraining would not be as effective as pelvic floor muscle training in this case.\n\nMirabegron is a beta-3 agonist that relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder, increasing bladder capacity. As the primary problem with stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, mirabegron would not be the first-line treatment in this case.\n\nOxybutynin is an antimuscarinic that is also prescribed for an overactive bladder. Again, this relaxes the detrusor muscles but as the primary pathology in stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, this would not be the first-line management step here.\n\nTamsulosin is an alpha-1 antagonist which relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and urethra.

If the patient were to have an insulinoma, then during fasting the blood glucose would become low, with elevated serum insulin and C-peptide, as C-peptide corresponds to endogenous rather than exogenous insulin. If the patient had hypoglycaemia during a fast with elevated insulin but low C-peptide the diagnosis would more likely be exogenous insulin use. A CT scan of the abdomen can be used if insulinoma is suspected following supervised fasting. Synacthen testing should be used to suspected Addison's disease."

The level suggests the cause is most likely pancreatitis. A perforated small bowel would more likely show free gas on a Chest X ray, diminished bowel sounds and guarding. Diabetic ketoacidosis would show more ketones on urinalysis and is rare, although still possible, in type 2 diabetics.\n\nThe gentleman has no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction. This combined with a normal liver function tests makes gallstone unlikely. The patient denies alcohol intake and non-alcoholic fatty liver can produce the appearances on ultrasound scan.\n\nBoth dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) and glucagon like peptide-1 agonists have been linked to pancreatitis. They are still both under investigation but is to be discontinued in the event of an episode of pancreatitis."

The most appropriate next step is magnesium replacement, which is likely to facilitate both an improvement in calcium and resolution of SVT.\n\nFurther IV calcium will be ineffective without first replacing magnesium, and potassium is within the normal range, as is glucose. Phosphate replacement may be required in the treatment of alcoholism, but this is usually in the context of refeeding syndrome."

Although lactate is mildly raised, this is likely secondary to intravascular dehydration and hypoperfusion of internal organs. Lactic acidosis alone does not account for the full biochemical picture. Ketones are present and the patient is mild acidotic. However, be aware that neither is sufficiently significant for a diagnosis of DKA."

Loss of function results in reduced cortisol and aldosterone and subsequent elevation in ACTH. This causes overstimulation of the adrenal cortex (hyperplasia). The steroid precursors are forced down the sex hormone pathway leading to androgen excess (ambiguous genitalia, salt wasting, hypovolaemia and shock i.e classic type). Presentation of 21 hydroxylase deficiency can also be asymptomatic with androgen excess become a problem in late childhood i.e. non-classic (premature pubarche, accelerated bone age, acne, hirsutism, oligomenorrhoea and this mimics polycystic ovarian syndrome).\n\n2. 11-beta hydroxylase mutation (5% of CAH).\n\nRaised BP as 11-deoxycortisol has some aldosterone activity. Also raised androgens.\n\n3. 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency\n\nRaised aldosterone but low androgens.\n\n4. 3-beta steroid dehydrogenase\n\nLow aldosterone and low androgens.\n\nThe short synacthen test is helpful when 17OH-progesterone is only modestly elevated (if 17OH-progesterone is very high then it is diagnostic). Measuring 17OH-progesterone at 0 and 60 mins after ACTH causes elevated responses in patients with CAH (&gt;35 nmol/L)."

This patient has metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia, proteinuria and glycosuria. The presence of proteinuria and glycosuria suggest a problem at the proximal convoluted tubule, as protein and glucose should be fully reabsorbed at this part of the nephron. Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is a consequence of a defect of the proximal tubular cells, leading to incomplete protein and glucose reabsorption, as well as defective bicarbonate reabsorption leading to acidosis. This is the most likely diagnosis in this patient and has likely been precipitated by the drug topiramate.\n\nMembranous glomerulonephritis is incorrect. To diagnose membranous glomerulonephritis, one would expect to see nephrotic range proteinuria (&gt;3g per 24h), and ideally, histological confirmation on renal biopsy. Membranous glomerulonephritis is more associated with NSAIDs and penicillamine than topiramate and is unlikely to cause metabolic acidosis in the context of the normal renal function seen here.\n\nType 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although this can cause hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis, the distal tubular cells are affected rather than the cells of the proximal tubule. This means there is less of an association with proteinuria and glycosuria. Finally, topiramate is not known to precipitate type 1 renal tubular acidosis.\n\nType 3 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This tends to be seen in children or as a result of congenital carbonic anhydrase deficiency. It is epidemiologically far rarer than type 2 renal tubular acidosis and is not specifically associated with topiramate use.\n\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalaemia and tends to be associated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and NSAIDs rather than topiramate."

No treatment required\n\nMODY associated with HNF1A often respond well to treatment with low-dose sulfonylureas\n\nGenetic testing would be required to confirm, but the likely diagnosis here is MODY3 which is associated with HNF1A mutations. These mutations are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The presentation is often incidental, with recurrent hyperglycaemia without ketosis.\n\nLow dose gliclazide is the correct answer. HNF1A mutations lead to a reduction in the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas.\n\nMetformin is incorrect. The main mechanism of action of metformin is increased sensitivity to insulin. Gliclazide is the preferred treatment as the HNF1A mutation reduces insulin production by the pancreas. It responds better to insulin secretagogue treatment than an insulin-sensitising agent.\n\nInsulin is incorrect. Most patients with MODY do not require insulin as there is generally some insulin secretion from the pancreas particularly in early diagnosis. Treatment with a secretagogue such as gliclazide is therefore preferable.\n\nNo treatment required is incorrect. All forms of MODY apart from glucokinase MODY increase the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. Treatment to stabilise and control blood glucose levels is therefore advisable.\n\nDietary advice and lifestyle changes is an incorrect answer. Although this advice would form part of the management, the main treatment would be pharmacological with a low dose of gliclazide. Unlike in early type-2 diabetes or pre-diabetes where there is a possibility of improving insulin sensitivity by decreasing glucose spikes, MODY is not reversible."

Rash, headache, fever and malaise commonly occur as well, but can usually be managed with analgesia and antihistamines. Loss of vision could occur in the case of moderate to severe Graves' disease with orbitopathy and starting on radioiodine, which can worsen thyroid eye disease.

He immigrated from Albania one year ago and has been noticed to be always tired and lacking energy. He has also found to have low sexual desire after starting a new relationship in the UK. On examination he is tall and slim, with slight gynaecomastia. What is the most appropriate investigation after confirming the low morning testosterone?\n\n- a) Prolactin\n- b) LH and FSH\n- c) MRI pituitary\n- d) Morning cortisol\n- e) Synacthen test\n\nAnswer is B\n\nA patient with low testosterone should have LH and FSH tested as first line investigation to separate primary and secondary hypogonadism\n\nThis is a patient with biochemical and clinical evidence of low testosterone. He is symptomatic with low energy and low sexual desire, and most likely would have erectile problems if questioned. The history of immigration is important as it raises the possibility of missed childhood diagnoses, in this case implying a missed chromosomal disorder. The most appropriate investigation to differentiate primary from secondary hypogonadism is LH and FSH. If LH and FSH are elevated this would suggest a primary hypogonadism such as Klinefelter's syndrome, as is suggested by the description of this patient, but if it is not then a secondary cause should be found. If that were the case, then MRI of pituitary can be necessary, as well as morning cortisol and prolactin. Synacthen testing should be done if morning cortisol is low to confirm adrenal insufficiency."

On examination she is found to have a 5 cm nodule on the thyroid gland that moves on swallowing.\n\nShe has a past medical history of anxiety/depression and currently takes sertaline 100mg od. Her mother was diagnosed as having hypothyroidism in her 60's.\n\nThyroid functions tests are shown below:\n\n| Free T4   | 14 pmol/l   |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| TSH       | 2.6 mu/l    |\n\nA fine needle aspiration of the mass is consistent with papillary thyroid cancer. There is no current evidence of metastases. What is the most appropriate treatment?\n\n- a) Total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131\n- b) Localised radiotherapy\n- c) Total thyroidectomy\n- d) Total thyroidectomy followed by localised radiotherapy\n- e) Radioiodine-13\n\nThe correct answer is Total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131 . In the case of a patient with papillary thyroid cancer, the recommended treatment is total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131 therapy. Total thyroidectomy removes the entire gland, which eliminates the primary tumor and any remaining microscopic disease. Radioiodine-131 is then used to ablate any residual thyroid tissue and treat potential microscopic metastases.\n\nLocalised radiotherapy is not the most appropriate treatment in this case because it may not effectively remove all cancerous cells. Additionally, papillary thyroid cancer is typically less sensitive to radiation compared to other types of cancers. Therefore, radiotherapy alone would be insufficient in treating the patient's condition.\n\nTotal thyroidectomy without adjuvant therapy may not be enough to treat papillary thyroid cancer as there could still be residual thyroid tissue or microscopic metastases after surgery. Radioiodine-131 helps to eliminate these remaining tissues and reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nTotal thyroidectomy followed by localised radiotherapy is also not considered the best option for this patient because papillary thyroid cancer usually responds better to radioiodine-131 therapy than external beam radiation. Localised radiotherapy might be considered in cases where there are contraindications for using radioactive iodine or if there are gross extrathyroidal extensions that cannot be completely resected surgically.\n\nFinally, Radioiodine-131 alone would not be an effective treatment for a large nodule like this one since it relies on uptake by functional thyroid tissue. Without prior surgical removal of the bulk of the tumor through total thyroidectomy, it would likely have limited effectiveness in eradicating all cancerous cells."

Toxic multinodular goitre\n\nThis woman's clinical presentation and thyroid function tests are consistent with a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid scintigraphy shows global uptake which is consistent with Grave's disease. Grave's disease is therefore the correct answer.\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is a cause of hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. This cannot be the case as confirmed by the thyroid function tests and is therefore incorrect.\n\nSubacute thyroiditis is a possibility due to this woman's recent illness. This often results in subacute hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism. Scintigraphy shows decreased uptake in this condition which is not the case in this instance. This is therefore not the correct answer.\n\nThyroid cancers can cause hyperthyroidism however scintigraphy would show a discrete mass with increased uptake rather than homogenous uptake. This is not the case here and therefore Grave's disease is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nToxic multinodular goitre is another cause of hyperthyroidism however is associated with patchy uptake on thyroid scintigraphy. As the uptake in this instance is homogenous, this is unlikely to be the underlying cause."

The patient presents with ophthalmological features of Graves' disease in association with fever, confusion, tachycardia, tremor, hypertension and clinical evidence of heart failure. In the setting of significant hyperthyroidism this constitutes a 'thyroid storm'. Propylthiouracil has traditionally been the preferred anti-thyroid drug to be used in this setting due to its more rapid onset of action when compared with carbimazole and its additional ability to inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.\n\nAntibiotics is not the right answer. Although this patient has a fever, she has a normal CRP and WCC and infection is less likely than thyroid storm given the clinical context.\n\nCarbimazole is incorrect. This can be used in thyroid storm but is less preferred due to its slower onset of action.\n\nRadioactive iodine therapy is incorrect. This can be used to manage Graves' disease but is not an option acutely for treating thyroid storm.\n\nSurgery is incorrect. This is an option for the treatment of Graves disease but is not an option for the acute treatment of thyroid storm."

A low IGF-1 in such a clinical context may point towards GHD, which needs to be confirmed with dynamic tests for GH secretion. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the gold standard for assessing GH secretion, although it needs to be conducted carefully in a closely-monitored space due to the risks associated with hypoglycaemia.\n\nITT is contra-indicated in patients with seizures or ischaemic heart disease. As a result, an alternative test such as arginine-GHRH stimulation test is employed (as in this clinical scenario where the patient has IHD). About 30-40% of patients with GHD may have a normal IGF-1 level. IGF-1 levels are influenced by age, time of onset of GHD, and degree of hypopituitarism. Domperidone test is used in the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinaemia associated disorders while glucose tolerance test with measurement of IGF-1 levels is used in the evaluation of suspected acromegaly."

Switch to VRII, continue current IV fluids and add IV dextrose\n\nDKA in the acute setting fixed rate insulin should be continued even if BM levels are &lt;14; IV dextrose should be added instead\n\nContinue FRII and add IV dextrose is correct. The patient has not yet had a resolution of ketonaemia or acidosis. The underlying pathophysiology of DKA is insulin deficiency. Without insulin, the body cannot use glucose for energy and therefore fat sources are broken down to use as fuel, prompting the generation of ketones, which in turn cause acidosis. To reverse this process and resolve ketonemia and acidosis, we need to continue insulin. Insulin therapy causes a lowering of blood glucose levels and therefore we should administer IV dextrose alongside insulin in order to prevent hypoglycaemia while allowing continued insulin administration.\n\nNo changes to current management is incorrect. Insulin drives glucose into cells and lowers blood glucose levels. We need to continue insulin until the ketonemia has resolved. However, this will cause hypoglycaemia unless we add IV dextrose.\n\nStop FRII and continue 0.9% sodium chloride with added potassium is incorrect. While this will result in the resolution of dehydration and avoid precipitating hypoglycaemia (as insulin has been stopped), it will not correct the underlying pathophysiological process (insulin deficiency) and the DKA will worsen.\n\nStop current management and switch to IV dextrose is not the right answer. Stopping insulin will resulting in worsening DKA, compounded by exogenous glucose administration.\n\nSwitch to VRII, continue current IV fluids and add IV dextrose is incorrect. It is standard practice now to administer a fixed rate insulin infusion in DKA rather than a variable rate as an FRII has been proven to be superior as it has been shown to have the following benefits:\n\n- \uf0b7 Faster resolution of DKA\n- \uf0b7 Avoids titration against a poor surrogate marker of blood glucose\n- \uf0b7 Confirms resolution of DKA if the FRII is stopped when blood ketone levels are &lt; 0.6mmol/L."

Pioglitazone, an oral antidiabetic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. In the presence of non-visible haematuria (blood in urine), this medication should be discontinued until further investigations are completed.\n\nAspirin is not typically associated with haematuria and its use as antiplatelet therapy in a patient with ischemic heart disease should not be interrupted without a compelling reason.\n\nRamipril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is used for hypertension and cardiac conditions.

Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome display clinical and biochemical features similar to those seen in Cushing's syndrome, such as the scenario here, but the presentation is caused by alcohol abuse, rather than an endogenous source or steroid use. Other causes of pseudoCushing's include severe depression, eating disorders, and chronic illness.

Unilateral adrenalectomy\n3. Watch and wait\n4. Low sodium diet\n5. Spironolactone\n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism: manage with spironolactone\n\nThe correct answer is spironolactone. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia can be safely and successfully managed with an aldosterone antagonist (either spironolactone or eplerenone) as this will reduce the effects of aldosterone.\n\nThere is no indication for surgical management in the treatment of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia so there is no rationale for an adrenalectomy. A low sodium diet is a reasonable lifestyle modification for hypertensive patients, but there is an underlying cause so medical management is more appropriate in this case.\n\nWatch and wait would be inappropriate as there is a clear diagnosis and a treatment."

Evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor which interferes with degradation of the LDL receptor is the most appropriate intervention and can reduce LDL by a further 50%. Given his relatively young age and high lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, he is exactly the type of patient likely to benefit from PCSK9 inhibition.\n\nCholestyramine was formerly used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, it is a cholesterol binding resin, but is less effective in lowering cholesterol than a statin. Both fenofibrate and nicotinic acid have most effect in lowering triglyerides, and changing atorvastatin to rosuvastatin is likely to have limited benefit in further lowering LDL."

Over the past six months, he had been experiencing urinary frequency, fatigue and increased thirst.\n\nHe had a past medical history of obesity and hypertension and his brother had type II diabetes mellitus. His only medication was ramipril. He was a heavy smoker with a 20 pack year history.\n\nOn examination of the arms, there was weakness of thumb abduction bilaterally and diminished sensation over the radial three and a half digits. Percussion over the palmar aspect of the wrist reproduced the paraesthesia he described on presentation.

He had a protuberant abdomen and an elevated body mass index (BMI).\n\nWhich of the following investigations is most likely to be diagnostic?\n\n- a) Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Pituitary and visual field testing\n- b) Fasting glucose on three occasions, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and a 9am cortisol measurement\n- c) Growth hormone measurement and dexamethasone suppression test\n- d) Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram (EMG)\n- e) Oral glucose tolerance test with serum glucose, IGF-1 and growth hormone measurements\n\nThis gentleman has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome with an underlying diagnosis of acromegaly.\n\nThe features in the question which point to the diagnosis of acromegaly include the presence of a recent increase in hand size and known complications of acromegaly such as diabetes mellitus (polyuria and polydipsia), acanthosis nigricans (pigmentation in the axillae) and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nThe increased BMI and striae could be indicative of underlying Cushing's disease, but in this case, this were red herrings.\n\nThe diagnosis of acromegaly is made when there is a failure to suppress the release of growth hormone during an oral glucose tolerance test. This test also allows the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to be made. Due to the diurnal variation in growth hormone levels, a random measurement is not helpful in making a diagnosis.\n\nAlthough an MRI scan of the pituitary and visual field testing are very important investigations and can confirm the presence of a pituitary adenoma they will not confirm or exclude a diagnosis of acromegaly.\n\nA fasting glucose and HbA1c measurement may aid the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but not acromegaly.\n\nA 9 am cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test could be used to investigate Cushing's syndrome and therefore are not relevant here.\n\nNerve conduction studies and electromyography would confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome but not the underlying cause, i.e. acromegaly."

The most appropriate and likely to be successful strategy is to change Levemir to Degludec. Degludec has a much higher half-life than Levemir and therefore maintains a basal insulin level when the patient omits or forgets doses. This can prevent DKA. Metformin is not indicated for this patient. Insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30) would allow reduction in the number of insulin injections. Increasing the dose of insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to prvent DKA for this patient as the fundamental issue is missing doses, and the short-term nature of the insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to provide any insulin cover for further omitted doses. Patients with type 1 diabetes can also benefit from DAFNE, a course which helps patients adjust their insulin doses to what they are eating and the patient should be offered this as an educational tool as well to improve control."

This lady's symptoms predate her pregnancy, therefore it is not pregnancy induced thyrotoxicosis and will not self-limit - she will need treatment to prevent complications to her and the foetus. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated. Subtotal thyroidectomy is a little risky and extreme during pregnancy. Carbimazole, whilst normally first line, has been associated with neonatal aplasia cutis before 12 weeks gestation and is therefore usually avoided. This leaves propylthiouracil as the current safest option. During the second trimester, propylthiouracil should be changed to carbimazole due to the potential risk of hepatotoxicity with propylthiouracil. The lowest dose that controls the hyperthyroid state should be used as both medications can cross the placenta."

The water deprivation test confirms a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) due to a failure of the urine to concentrate with dehydration (urine osmolarity &lt;300 mmol/L). Following administration of desmopressin there is a &gt;50% rise in urine osmolarity confirming the diagnosis of cranial DI.\n\nPartial cranial diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This subtype of cranial DI is confirmed when the patient's symptoms resolve with desmopressin however the urine osmolarity fails to meet the diagnostic criteria (e.g. &gt;50% increase).\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This condition is characterised by the failure of the urine to concentrate with desmopressin.\n\nPrimary polydipsia is incorrect. This condition is characterised by a normal physiological response to water deprivation e.g. the urine will concentrate (&gt;600 mmol/L).\n\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release is incorrect. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) is associated with hyponatraemia, a decreased plasma osmolarity (&lt;275 mOsm/kg), a relatively low urine osmolarity (&lt; 100 mOsm/kg), and a high urinary sodium (&gt; 40 mmol/L)."

She was admitted four days ago following a month of feeling unwell with vomiting, postural dizziness and weight loss. Following a Synacthen test, she was diagnosed with Addison's disease. She was started on treatment with hydrocortisone three times a day, as well as fludrocortisone on a daily basis. She has had no other medical problems or treatments in the past. She has been taking hydrocortisone 10mg at 09:00 and then 5mg at 12:00 and 15:00. On discharge she informs the medical team that she sometimes does shift-work. What is the most appropriate advise to give regarding steroid dosing for night shifts?\n\n- f) Take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00 regardless of shift patterns\n- g) Adjust to take first dose at waking, then doses at three hours and six hours from starting\n- h) On shift days take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00, but also take an additional 10mg at starting shift\n- i) On shift days take doses at 09:00, but then take second dose at starting shift and third dose six hours into shift\n- j) On shift days omit taking steroids\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nFor patients on steroid replacement when working shift work, doses should be taken from when waking\n\nPatients with Addison's disease need both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Cortisol is highly linked to diurnal rhythm - which is why cortisol naturally peaks in the morning and is at its nadir between midnight and 04:00. Replacement should aim to match the natural rhythm as much as possible; dosing is normally split between three doses, first on waking, then at midday and early afternoon. When a patient shifts their daytime routine, such as working on night shifts or travelling, the patient should be advised to take their morning dose on waking and maintain the timing from there. Patients should not be advised to omit doses, and encouraged to always ensure they are well supplied."

This finished one year ago. Following this, she has retained a clinically and biochemically euthyroid state. She originally presented with weight loss and insomnia, and these symptoms have not re-occurred. Her GP has requested blood tests prior to the appointment which has shown a TSH of 2.6 and a free T4 of 8.2mg/dl. She wanted to have a review as she has recently stopped taking oral contraceptive tablets and is planning to become pregnant. What is the most appropriate plan?\n\n- f) Advise to avoid pregnancy\n- g) Measure serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies\n- h) Arrange for US scan of neck\n- i) Repeat TSH and free T4 in one year's time\n- j) Measure thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nPregnant woman with a history of Grave's disease should have thyroid stimulating hormone binding antibody titres measured even if euthyroid as the antibodies can cross the placental barrier\n\nThis is a patient with a past medical history of Graves' disease who is clinically and biochemically euthyroid who is planning pregnancy. It is important, even with no biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism, to exclude the serum presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies as these can cross the placenta and cause foetal problems. If they were positive, then treatment should be initiated to control the antibody levels, despite the normal TSH and T4. Thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies should be checked in hyperthyroidism at 30-36 weeks gestation to help assess the risk of neonatal thyroid problems. There is no reason she should not become pregnant."

The clinical and biochemical features suggest non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This form is milder, more common, and often diagnosed in later childhood or early adulthood. Usually, women with non-classic CAH present with signs of excess androgens (i.e., excess body hair, early puberty, irregular periods). Hypoaldosteronism (e.g. hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis) can also occur. The biochemical features and low early morning cortisol in this case are highly suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.\n\nDexamethasone suppression test is incorrect. Although Cushing's disease remains within the differential diagnosis, there are no other clinical (e.g. hypertension, proximal myopathy, weight gain, easy bruising) or biochemical features (e.g. hyperglycaemia, hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia) to support this diagnosis. Furthermore, the low early morning cortisol makes this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nKaryotyping is incorrect. Although Turner's syndrome can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.\n\nSerum prolactin is incorrect. Although hyperprolactinaemia can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.\n\nTransvaginal ultrasound is incorrect. Although ovarian tumours can result in androgen excess, this usually results in virilization which is not present in this case. Furthermore, hypoaldosteronism would not be expected to occur with ovarian pathology.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve"

She also reports fatigue, tremors, nervousness, occasional palpitations, and unintentional weight loss. Examination reveals blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and temperature of 37.8 \u00baC. The thyroid gland is tender on palpation and enlarged without any palpable nodules. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\n| TSH     | 0.1 mIU/L ng/mL   | (0.4 - 4.0)   |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Free T4 | 8 ng/dL           | (0.7 - 1.9)   |\n| ESR     | 101 mm/hr         |               |\n\nAnti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies are mildly elevated, while radioactive iodine uptake is low.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- f) Acute infectious thyroiditis\n- g) Graves disease\n- h) Hashimoto thyroiditis\n- i) Solitary toxic nodule\n- j) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nThyrotoxicosis with tender goitre = subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis\n\nSubacute granulomatous thyroiditis , also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, is the correct diagnosis. The patient presents with clinical and biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by tachycardia, tremors, nervousness, low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, palpitations, suppressed TSH, and elevated free T4 levels. These symptoms, in conjunction with an enlarged tender thyroid gland and high ESR level, are indicative of de Quervain's thyroiditis. Typically following a viral infection (not specified in this scenario), this condition is characterised by an initial phase of thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. Management often involves symptomatic relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and betablockers.\n\nAcute infectious thyroiditis , or suppurative thyroiditis, is a rare and potentially serious condition usually seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Gram-positive bacterial infections mainly cause it. Symptoms include sudden-onset fever, chills, malaise, a tender, painful thyroid gland, and signs of hyperthyroidism. In severe cases, the infection causes compression on adjacent structures, leading to dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. It is important to note that de Quervain's thyroiditis has a gradual onset of symptoms and does not cause compression symptoms, making acute infectious thyroiditis less likely.\n\nGraves' disease is not the appropriate diagnosis here. Despite the biochemical and clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, specific anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and a low radioactive iodine uptake are inconsistent with this condition.\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is a relevant differential diagnosis; however, it typically presents with a painless goitre. In de Quervain's thyroiditis, mild elevations in antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies may be observed in fewer than 25% of cases. By contrast, these antibody levels are significantly higher in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\nSolitary toxic nodule is not consistent with this case presentation. Such nodules are generally single, palpable and non-tender associated with thyrotoxicosis. In contrast to this condition, the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and tender with no palpable; the findings align with de Quervain's thyroiditis rather than a solitary toxic nodule."

On examination his blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, his pulse is 85 beats per minute and regular. Emergency blood testing reveal elevated ketones and a glucose of 12.2 mmol/l.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his glucose control?\n\n- f) Add liraglutide\n- g) Add long-acting insulin\n- h) Change the empagliflozin for liraglutide\n- i) Change the empagliflozin for long-acting insulin\n- j) Stop the metformin\n\n## Correct answer is d.\n\nGiven the duration of Type 2 diabetes and the fact that patient has lost weight in the past month, the possibility that he is insulinopenic is raised. In this situation, calorie loss and metabolic disturbance can be exacerbated by the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and patients may present as here, with euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The SGLT-2 inhibitor should be withdrawn, and given he is insulinopaenic, long-acting insulin added.\n\nIn this situation the empagliflozin must be withdrawn, therefore options including adding liraglutide and long-acting insulin are incorrect. GLP-1 agonists such as liraglutide work less well in patients who are relatively insulinopenic, so liraglutide is incorrect. Stopping the metformin won't remove the cause of ketosis, the empagliflozin."

Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option.

Due to increased glucocorticoid production, symptoms include weight gain and hyperglycaemia as seen in this patient. Hypertension is another common finding also seen here. Laboratory tests may reveal hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The best test to diagnose Cushing's syndrome is the low-dose dexamethasone test. This has been done for this patient and shows a cortisol level that has not been suppressed despite exogenous steroid use. Once Cushing's syndrome has been confirmed, additional localisation tests need to be completed. One of these includes the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test which is used to discriminate between Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production. Suppressed cortisol levels following high doses of glucocorticoids confirms a pituitary cause, as opposed to normal levels of cortisol that suggest an adrenal cause.\n\nThe insulin stress test is used to differentiate Cushing's syndrome from pseudoCushing's. Pseudo-Cushing's presents similarly to Cushing's syndrome; however, rather than being caused by excessive corticosteroid levels, it is due to alcohol excess or severe depression. There is nothing in this patient's history to suggest depression or alcohol excess. Furthermore, the positive finding following the lowdose dexamethasone suppression test points away from a diagnosis of pseudoCushing's.\n\nPetrosal sinus ACTH sampling is another investigation that can be used to help distinguish between a pituitary or adrenal cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is an invasive investigation and easier tests such as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test should be considered first.\n\nA pituitary MRI can be used to diagnose a pituitary cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the next recommended investigation. Rather, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is easier and cheaper to complete and should be completed next.\n\nUrinary cortisol is used as an initial investigation in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is not a specific localisation test."

Her past medical history includes hypothyroidism and hypertension, for which she takes levothyroxine and amlodipine.\n\nShe last saw the GP two weeks previously when she was started on ferrous sulphate due to mild anaemia.\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of her symptoms?\n\n- f) Bowel malignancy\n- g) Addison's disease\n- h) Amlodipine toxicity\n- i) Undercorrected hypothyroidism\n- j) Worsening anaemia\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThe most likely explanation here is undercorrected hypothyroidism. Ferrous sulphate is well known to reduce the absorption of other medications, particularly levothyroxine. Patients should be advised to take these tablets separately from their regular medications.\n\nAlthough anaemia in a post-menopausal woman should always be investigated, there are no symptoms to suggest malignancy here. Addison's disease would be unlikely to cause weight gain."

    "block": "## Question #346\n\nA 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a collapse at the local supermarket. She tells you that she always feels weak and washed out, and hardly ever has any energy. She takes no regular medication and virtually never sees the doctor. On examination her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. She is slim with a body mass index of 21 kg/m\u00b2, no abnormal physical signs are noted.\n\n## Investigations\n\n| Na +        | 140 mmol/l   |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| K +         | 3.1 mmol/l   |\n| HCO3 -      | 32 mmol/l    |\n| Urea        | 5.9 mmol/l   |\n| Creatinin e | 85 \u00b5mol/l    |\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- f) Conn's syndrome\n- g) Cushing's syndrome\n- h) Gitelman's syndrome\n- i) Liddle's syndrome\n- j) Renal tubular acidosis type\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nGitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria\n\nThis patient has hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal / low blood pressure. This fits best with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Bartter's syndrome often presents in infancy as failure to thrive, and isn't listed as a distractor. Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option. Gitelman's is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter, and results in a clinical picture similar to that expected with thiazide diuretic use.\n\nConn's syndrome is associated with hypertension, as is Liddle's syndrome, effectively ruling them out as diagnoses here. Renal tubular acidosis type 1 is associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis, not with a bicarbonate of 32."
