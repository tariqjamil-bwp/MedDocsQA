She says that she can feel her heart pounding after which she becomes dizzy and feels faint. She has noted these bouts about three to four times per day. She does not suffer from diabetes and is not hypertensive.\n\nShe was diagnosed as having a UTI 4 days ago which is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin. Her medication history includes olanzapine and occasional paracetamol for her headaches.\n\nOn examination, her pulse was 135 bpm with an irregular rhythm. Blood pressure was 90/60mmHg. Attachment to a cardiac monitor revealed runs of ill sustained polymorphic tachycardia. She was immediately given IV lidocaine to which there was no response.\n\nWhich is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n- a) Immediate DC cardioversion\n- b) IV amiodarone\n- c) IV flecainide\n- d) IV magnesium sulphate\n- e) IV labetalol\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThe scenario above is an acquired long QT syndrome secondary to both ciprofloxacin and olanzapine. Patients with long QT syndromes develop syncope and palpitations as a result of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Episodes may terminate spontaneously which is usual, but may also evolve into fatal ventricular fibrillation. The corrected QT interval in between the arrhythmia is usually &gt;0.5s."

He has no known past medical history or family history. He is well and leads an active lifestyle. On examination, you note a pansystolic murmur in the apex. Chest auscultation is unremarkable. An ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm at 64 beats/minute with no changes suggestive of ventricular hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated good views with severe mitral regurgitation, preserved left ventricular function (EF 85%) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 15 mmHg. Which of the following is appropriate management?\n\n- a) Mitral valve replacement\n- b) Mitral valve repair\n- c) Percutaneous mitral valve repair (Mitraclip)\n- d) Infective endocarditis prophylaxis and 6 monthly echocardiogram\n- e) 6 monthly echocardiogram\n\nCorrec answer is e.\n\nThe patient has severe chronic non-ischaemic mitral regurgitation that has not decompensated. The aetiology is unclear: primary causes include mitral valve prolapse, flail leaflet or rheumatic heart disease. Secondary causes include cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease.\n\nThe patient does not meet indications for intervention on the mitral valve , which include\n\n1. symptoms,\n2. left ventricular dysfunction,\n3. pulmonary hypertension,\n4. new atrial fibrillation and\n5. Dilated left ventricle.\n\nIt is uncommon for intervention to take place without any of the indications mentioned above. Instead, serial monitoring with 6 monthly echocardiograms is appropriate. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is no longer indicated for patients in the absence of a prosthetic valve repair or replacement.\n\nPercutaneous mitral valve repair is an emerging technique that is available to patients considered too high risk for mitral valve surgery, which uses a device to individually approximate the regurgitant leaflet. Comparing Mitraclip with mitral valve replacement or repair in severe mitral regurgitation patients with NYHA III/IV heart failure symptoms, one-year and four-year survival were similar with similar improvements in symptoms, LV size and function. However, Mitraclip patients demonstrated significantly higher incidence of requiring further surgery but significantly lower risks of major adverse events post-procedure."

He is noted to have a blood pressure of 95/63mmHg and a heart rate of 98bpm. An ECG confirms sinus rhythm. He has previously developed symptoms of wheeze with beta blockade. He is commenced on ivabradine 5mg twice daily by his cardiologist.\n\nWhich of the following should the patient be warned of as a recognised side effect of ivabradine?\n\n- a) Neutrophilia\n- b) Hypotension\n- c) Phosphenes\n- d) Diaphoresis\n- e) Renal failure\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nIvabradine use may be associated with visual disturbances including phosphenes and green luminescence\n\nIvabradine is a second line agent for rate control in the treatment of chronic heart failure in those in whom beta-blockade is contraindicated, not tolerated or therapy fails. Other rate limiting drugs such as the calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil may sometimes be used but hypotension often limits their use. Digoxin too can sometimes be used, even in sinus rhythm although the rate limiting effect it has is relatively modest; often digoxin and ivabradine are ultimately used in conjunction.\n\nNICE guidelines on the use of ivabradine give clear criteria on its use; the patient must have at least a moderate degree of heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fracture of &lt;35%, they must be stable on optimal doses of other heart failure medications including angiotensin system modulators, an aldosterone receptor antagonist and a beta blocker if not contraindicated. It is important the patient is regularly monitored by a community heart failure team to titrate the dose. Ivabradine can also only be used in patients in sinus rhythm. It works by selectively inhibiting the If [ionic funny] channel which is a sodium/potassium symporter channel largely expressed within the sinoatrial node. Inhibition of this channel slows the intrinsic rhythmicity of the hearts pacemaker function. Pharmaceutical bradycardia aids in the management of cardiac failure as it allows improved diastolic filling and reduced myocardial oxygen usage.\n\nSide effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, ventricular escape rhythms, dizziness, headache, muscle cramps and eosinophilia. Neutrophilia is rarely seen with ivabradine. Hypotension is also not seen with ivabradine use which makes it an important drug in the arsenal when treating patients with cardiac failure in whom other rate limiting drugs may be relatively contraindicated.\n\nAn important side effect with ivabradine however is that of visual disturbance including the phenomenon of phosphenes, or 'flashing lights'. Other visual symptoms described include green discolouration of visual field, blurring of vision and scintillating scotomata. These visual symptoms are usually transient and mild. They arise due to inhibition of similar ionic funny channels in the retina to the sinoatrial If channels. Approximately 20% of patients taking the drug develop some form of visual disturbance but only 1% need to discontinue therapy because of it.\n\nThe use of ivabradine in renal dysfunction is not well established however manufacturers recommend it may be used with estimated glomerular filtration rates above 15ml/min. There is no evidence its use causes renal dysfunction although mild rises in plasma creatinine levels may be seen."

The rash is transient and seems to mostly occur in the summertime. She has a past medical history of hypertension, palindromic rheumatism and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. She takes amlodipine, furosemide, indapamide and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nOn examination, there is a maculopapular rash on her chest and distal forearms. It is not itchy.\n\nBloods tests:\n\nAntinuclear antibody\n\nnegative\n\n## What is the likely explanation for her symptoms?\n\n- a) Furosemide\n- b) Hydroxychloroquine\n- c) Indapamide\n- d) Solar urticaria\n- e) Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nThiazides may cause photosensitivity\n\nIndapamide is correct. Thiazide diuretics are a well-recognised cause of a photosensitive rash. The patient's rash occurs mostly in the summertime and on sun-exposed areas and is therefore consistent with this reaction.\n\nFurosemide is incorrect. This is mainly associated with bullous skin reactions.\n\nSolar urticaria is incorrect. The rash, in this case, is maculopapular and nonpruritic and therefore is not consistent with a diagnosis of urticaria.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is incorrect. This medication is associated with rashes but is actually used to treat conditions associated with photosensitive rashes and is therefore not the likely cause.\n\nSLE is incorrect. Photosensitive rashes are common in lupus. However, the ANA is negative, which makes a diagnosis of the systemic form of lupus, overwhelmingly unlikely."

His breathlessness was associated with some mild, generalised chest discomfort, but the patient puts this down to a recent chest infection he has just recovered from.\n\nWhen assessed in the ED the patient's breathlessness has improved and he denies any further chest discomfort. He reports he has been experiencing more frequent similar episodes, gradually increasing in severity over several months. He reports he recently had a productive cough with coryzal symptoms for the last 3-4 days but he feels it is improving. On questioning he confirms his symptoms of breathlessness are often worse during and post these chest infections.\n\nHe has a past medical history of chronic renal artery stenosis and resultant poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple medications including an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker and a diuretic.\n\nAn ECG is performed as seen below.\n\nShows S in V1 plus R in V6= 44mm\n\nWhat is the patient's most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Brugada syndrome\n- b) Hyperkalaemia\n- c) Left ventricular hypertrophy\n- d) Pericarditis\n- e) Wellen's syndrome\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nThis patient has presented with symptoms and typical ECG changes in keeping with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The thickening of the cardiac muscle is most likely a result of chronic uncontrolled hypertension, hence the prolonged, progressive history. LV hypertrophy results in signs and symptoms of LV failure including breathlessness, angina and reduced exercise tolerance. The patient's ECG demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with ST elevation in V2-3, without reciprocal lead changes and the combination of the S wave in V1 with the R wave in V5 or V6 clearly exceeding 40 mm.\n\nBrugada syndrome is a genetic cardiac disorder resulting in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death. There are several types of Brugada syndrome with variation seen on ECG however the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as Brugada sign.\n\nThere is no clear reason why this patient would be hyperkalaemia. Although he has renal impairment it is not indicated that he has end-stage renal failure or that he is on renal replacement therapy therefore hyperkalaemia would not be expected. Common ECG changes noted in hyperkalaemia included peaked T waves, P wave widening/flattening, PR prolongation progressing to the bradyarrhythmias and conductions blocks. No clear features of hyperkalaemia can be seen on this patient's ECG.\n\nPericarditis is inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart and can be due to infections. Patients normally present with pleuritic, constant chest pain and fevers. Although this patient has a very recent chest infection, pericarditis normally develops a few weeks post the resolution of infection as it is an immune response and not a direct result of the infection itself. ECG findings associated with pericarditis include widespread concave ST elevation and PR depression which are not present on this patient's ECG.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic like symptoms. You would expect the patient's chest pain to be continuous and to be more severe if he was experiencing stenosis of the LAD."

Shortly after she arrives in hospital the pain resolves and a second ECG is entirely normal. She has had three similar episodes of chest pain in the past. All episodes of chest pain have come on at rest. Blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, heart rate is 90 beats per minute and hearts sounds are normal. She underwent coronary angiography following a previous episode of chest pain three weeks ago, which showed no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram is normal.\n\nWhat is the likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Acute anterolateral myocardial infarction\n- b) Crescendo angina\n- c) Da Costas syndrome\n- d) Prinzmetal's variant angina\n- e) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\n## Correct answer is d.\n\nThis woman is likely to be suffering from Prinzmetal's variant angina. Classically her pain occurs at rest and the ECG demonstrates ST segment elevation that disappears as the pain abates. Normal coronary angiography supports this diagnosis, however in many Prinzmetal's angina patients there is co-existing coronary artery disease. Symptoms and ECG changes are unlikely to be reproduced with exercise testing in Prinzmetal's angina.\n\nPrinzmetal's angina is caused by coronary artery spasm, however the underlying pathophysiology causing spasm is not currently well understood. In some patients it is associated with other vasospastic disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\n## The main stay of treatment is:\n\n- \uf0b7 Avoiding precipitants of spasm such as smoking.\n- \uf0b7 Calcium channel blockers, nitrates and/or nicorandil."

Therefore they have the same probability of being affected by an X linked recessive disease as males\n\nThe patient clearly has haemophilia A as indicated by the prolonged aPTT and severely reduced factor VIII levels.\n\n## Rare cases of females with severe haemophilia can occur due to\n\n1. extreme lyonization,\n2. homozygosity,\n3. mosaicism, or\n4. Turner syndrome .\n\nFemales with Turner's syndrome have just one X chromosome. Thus they have the same probability of being affected by an X linked recessive disease as males.

The patient's immediate post-operative recovery had been unremarkable and he had begun to mobilise with the ward physiotherapist. Routine observations recorded on the ward had been unremarkable during the previous 24 hours.\n\nDuring her drug round, the patient's nurse saw the patient suddenly become unable to breathe and clutch at his chest. After calling for help the nurse went to her patient and found him to be in cardiac arrest. Resuscitations attempts were initiated following advanced life-support protocol. Please see the below table for a summary of the patient's electrical rhythm and treatments administered during the initial phases of the resuscitation attempt.\n\nThe patient was noted to be in good physical health with his only comorbidity being hypertension, well controlled with medication. The patient's admission clerking recorded that he was a retired schoolteacher who lived independently at home with his wife. A review of the patient's drug chart indicated that he had been receiving subcutaneous enoxaparin as prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism, but that the patient had refused to wear compression stockings during his admission as he found them uncomfortable.\n\n|   Number of rhythm check | Result of rhythm check            | Treatment administered   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                        1 | Pulseless electrical activity     | IV adrenaline 1 mg       |\n|                        2 | Ventricular fibrillation (coarse) | DC shock 150 J           |\n|                        3 | Ventricular fibrillation          | ???                      |\n\nIn addition to a further DC shock, what is the appropriate choice of IV drug treatment following the third rhythm check?\n\n- a) IV adrenaline 1 mg\n- b) IV atropine 400 micrograms &amp; IV amiodarone 300 mg\n- c) No IV drug treatment indicated\n- d) IV adrenaline 1 mg &amp; IV amiodarone 300 mg\n- e) IV atropine 400 micrograms\n\n## Correct answer is a.\n\nThe advanced life support algorithm for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole requires adrenaline to be given immediately and then continued every 3 to 5 minutes (in practice, after every second rhythm check). By contrast, the algorithm for ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VF / VT) requires IV adrenaline to not be given until after the third shock and then continued every 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nHowever, once adrenaline has been given during a resuscitation attempt it should be given every 3-5 minutes even if the type of rhythm changes from PEA/asystole to VF / VT, even if this is only the second cycle of the rhythm being VF / VT (as in the example in the question).\n\nAs part of the VF / VT algorithm, IV amiodarone 300 mg should be given after three defibrillation attempts. A further dose of IV amiodarone 150 mg should be considered after a total of five defibrillation attempts. Atropine is not used as part of the advanced life-support algorithm."

When he pauses to rest, the pain dissipates within a few minutes. He has a past medical history of high cholesterol, for which he takes atorvastatin. The GP commences him on bisoprolol.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the patient re-attends, stating that the symptoms are still not under control.\n\n## What should be added next?\n\n- a) Amlodipine\n- b) Isosorbide mononitrate\n- c) Ivabradine\n- d) Nicorandil\n- e) Verapamil\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\n## If angina is not controlled with a beta-blocker, a longer-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker should be added\n\nThis patient is experiencing stable angina - the chest pain is occurring on exertion, but not at rest. NICE recommend the use of a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker (CCB) first-line. As this patient has been commenced on bisoprolol already, the next step is to add a CCB. A dihydropyridine CCB should be used, to avoid reducing the heart rate further, and so amlodipine is the most appropriate option here.\n\nIsosorbide mononitrate would be appropriate to use as a third agent, if the combination of a beta-blocker and CCB was not adequate. However, at this stage, a CCB should be added.\n\nSimilarly, ivabradine , which modulates the 'funny current', would be appropriate as a third agent instead of isosorbide mononitrate. A CCB should be added first, as this patient is only on bisoprolol.\n\nNicorandil is another alternative agent to be added third, instead of isosorbide mononitrate or ivabradine. It would not be appropriate to add currently, as the patient is only on bisoprolol.\n\nVerapamil is a non-dihydropyridine CCB. As such, it is negatively chronotropic and so should not be used alongside a beta-blocker; this may precipitate complete heart block. It would have been suitable as a first-line alternative to the betablocker."

He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) three months ago and started on bisoprolol. This was part of a plan to rate control, rather than rhythm control, his AF. The bisoprolol has been up-titrated as his symptoms did not come under control with his dose. Palpitations occur almost every day but are not associated with any other symptoms. He also has a history of ischaemic heart disease with a myocardial infarction five years ago and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He currently takes bisoprolol, metformin, aspirin and simvastatin. He has declined anticoagulation with warfarin or NOAC despite the risk as his wife died from an intracranial bleed whilst taking warfarin.\n\nOn examination, his heart rate is 94/min and irregular. His chest is clear on auscultation and there is no peripheral oedema. How should he be further managed?\n\n- a) Amiodarone\n- b) Dronedarone\n- c) Amlodipine\n- d) Diltiazem\n- e) Left atrial ablation\n\n## Correct answer is d.\n\nThe correct answer is diltiazem. This is a gentleman with symptomatic, but not decompensating, permanent AF which is not responding to first-line treatment with a beta-blocker (bisoprolol). NICE advises that first line treatment for a ratecontrol strategy in AF should be either a beta-blocker or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker, but digoxin can be considered for non-paroxysmal AF in patients who are not very active. If the first-line treatment fails, either with continuing symptoms or poor response of ventricular rate then a combination therapy with any of the following two can be used: beta-blocker, diltiazem, digoxin.\n\nAmiodarone, dronedarone and left atrial ablation are all strategies for cardioversion . Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker but is used in hypertension rather than in AF as it is not rate-limiting, and would therefore not help."

ARVD can present as palpitations, syncope, or sudden cardiac death similar to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Over time, the right ventricular myocardium is replaced by fibrofatty tissue and patients develop signs of right ventricular failure. This patient's echocardiogram finding of a hypokinetic right ventricular wall is suggestive of the diagnosis. The most characteristic ECG finding in ARVD is an epsilon wave . An epsilon wave is a positive deflection following the end of the QRS complex caused by post-excitation of right ventricular myocytes.\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is a common ECG finding of HOCM . HOCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death and can also present with palpitations and syncope, as seen in this patient. However, this patient's echocardiogram findings are in keeping with ARVD, of which the epsilon wave is the most characteristic ECG finding.\n\nAn Osborn wave (or J wave) is a positive deflection at the J point. There are multiple causes, of which the most common is hypothermia . Other causes of J waves include left ventricular hypertrophy and Brugada syndrome. However, an Osborn wave is not associated with ARVD.\n\nThere are multiple causes of right bundle branch block, including right ventricular hypertrophy . In ARVD, rather than hypertrophy of the right ventricle, the myocardium is replaced by fatty tissue. Right bundle branch block is not a sign of ARVD. Instead, the left bundle branch block is more likely to feature on an ECG of a patient with ARVD.\n\nA delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is commonly associated with pre-excitatory activity, such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome. It is not associated with ARVD."

His admission ECG shows a regular, narrow complex tachycardia. Vagal manoeuvres have been tried in the department with no success.

With reference to the Resuscitation UK guidelines, it has a place as a second line measure to vagal manoeuvres when no 'adverse features' are present. Adenosine works by transiently blocking the AV node by effect on the A1 receptor, causing potassium efflux and hyperpolarisation.\n\nDon't be side-tracked by the fact that this patient is asthmatic, yes this is a relative contraindication to the administration of adenosine, but that is not the question. Theophyllines have been known to antagonise adenosine necessitating higher dosages. Dipyridamole blocks the cellular uptake of adenosine, increasing concentration at receptors and potentiating its effect . Adenosine should therefore be used with caution, if at all, in patients taking dipyridamole, and certainly low starting doses should be considered."

These patients require a 7-day ECG Holter monitor to assess for episodes of complete (third degree) heart block. It is likely that a permanent cardiac pacemaker will be required to prevent further syncopal episodes.\n\nA tilt-table test is useful for investigating vasovagal syncope.\n\nThe patient may also have underlying structural heart disease so a transthoracic echo would also be prudent to perform.

The unifying diagnosis is amyloid cardiomyopathy, likely secondary to AL amyloid from B-cell dyscrasia, with cardiac, renal and possibly liver involvement. There is no evidence of a sudden onset cardiac event suggestive of an ischaemic cause. Echocardiogram does not demonstrate ventricular dilation, only impaired function. A 5mm pericardial effusion is not sufficiently significant to cause tamponade. Although chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is possible, it is difficult to tie in the delayed onset from the end of treatment with renal involvement. It also does not explain the echogenic pictures on transthoracic echo."

    "block": "## &gt;Question #18\n\nA 35-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with intermittent palpitations, breathlessness, and non-specific chest discomfort. The previous day she had found out that she was 14-weeks pregnant which had caused significant stress and anxiety. She has a long history of anxiety and depression, managed by cognitive behavioural therapy. She reported that she had intermittently had episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath for the past 10 years and had attributed this to her anxiety. These symptoms had worsened over the past couple of weeks and today her symptoms were intolerable. Her medications consisted of over-the-counter vitamin supplements.\n\nShe looked anxious, but otherwise, the examination was unremarkable. An ECG was performed showed normal sinus rhythm, T wave inversion in V1 - V3.\n\nWhilst in the emergency department, she complained of severe palpitations and dizziness.\n\nHer ECG was repeated showed, wide complex regular tachycardia with left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern. Heart rate 150 bpm. Fusion beats and capture beats present.\n\nAs she was being transferred into resus, she spontaneously cardioverted back to sinus rhythm.\n\nAn echocardiogram was performed:\n\nThe right ventricle is dilated with depressed right ventricular systolic function and localised apical aneurysm. Left ventricular size and function are normal.\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of her presentation?\n\n- a) Aortic dissection\n- b) Takutsubo cardiomyopathy\n- c) Peripartum cardiomyopathy\n- d) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n- e) Brugada syndrome\n\n## Correct Answer: d\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy - T wave inversion in V1-3. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterised by the replacement of the myocardium of the right ventricle with fibrofatty tissue. The abnormal fibrofatty tissue predisposes to ventricular tachycardia (VT), right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and can cause sudden death. It is often inherited but can be sporadic. Presentation is often with nonspecific palpitations, chest discomfort, and syncope. This patient has a typical presentation: the pregnancyassociated increase in stroke volume is likely the trigger for her symptoms recently worsening. Her two ECGs are characteristic: typical changes include inverted T waves in the precordial leads V1-V3 (looking at the right ventricle) with episodes of ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricle (giving the ECG a LBBB morphology as the arrhythmia takes an abnormal route of conduction from right to left through slowly-conducting myocardium rather than conducting tissue). Epsilon waves may also be seen in ARVC. Her echocardiogram is also characteristic - infiltration and thinning of the right ventricular wall can occur to the point that systolic function is impaired and an aneurysm forms.\n\nNote that the differential for a wide-complex regular tachycardia on an ECG includes SVT with aberrant conduction (as well as VT). However, the fusion beats and capture beats are more in keeping with VT in this case.\n\nThis patient's presentation is not typical for aortic dissection. An echo might see cardiac tamponade or new aortic regurgitation if this was the diagnosis but this is not the case here.\n\nTakutsubo cardiomyopathy is caused by transient systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), presenting similarly to an acute coronary syndrome. Patients typically have chest pain, a raised troponin, and ECG findings consistent with ischaemia such as ST elevation/T wave inversion. This is typically triggered by recent physical or emotional stress. Patients are initially managed as an ACS but cardiac angiography shows no significant coronary artery disease. Instead, the LV wall shows hypokinesis or akinesis which creates the shape of an 'octopus pot' during systole. It may be argued that this patient has experienced a recent stressor (the news of pregnancy) however her presentation, long history of symptoms, and echo findings are more in keeping with AVRC.\n\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare type of cardiomyopathy that is often dilated and occurs in late pregnancy or early postpartum (typically one month before or after birth). The aetiology is unclear but is thought to be multifactorial. Criteria for diagnosis of PPCM include impairment of LV systolic function (LVEF &lt;45%) which was not the case in this patient. Furthermore, this patient presented in the early second trimester - too early for PPCM but late enough for pregnancyrelated haemodynamic changes to trigger her underlying ARVC.\n\nLastly, Brugada syndrome is another important differential to consider in young patients with palpitations, ECG changes in V1-V3, and episodes of VT. Brugada is caused by an inherited mutation in the cardiac sodium channel. However, echocardiography is typically normal and an ECG may show unusual ST elevation in V1-V3 with T wave inversion in these leads."

He opens his eyes to pain, localises to pain, and makes incomprehensible sounds. His pulse is palpable at 180 bpm with BP 88/54 mmHg.\n\nECG demonstrates a wide complex monomorphic tachycardia with prolonged QRS 150msec.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next step?\n\n- a) Adrenaline\n- b) Amiodarone\n- c) Magnesium sulphate\n- d) Synchronised DC cardioversion\n- e) Unsynchronised DC cardioversion\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nA synchronised cardioversion is the treatment for a unstable patient in VT\n\nSynchronised DC cardioversion is the preferred treatment for tachyarrhythmia in unstable patients displaying life-threatening adverse signs. In this situation, unstable VT with a pulse should be managed with synchronised DC cardioversion. To convert atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the shock must be synchronised to occur with the R wave of the ECG. An unsynchronised shock could coincide with a T wave and cause ventricular fibrillation (VF).\n\nAdrenaline 1mg 1:10000 is used in the ALS algorithm in the treatment of unconscious patients with shockable and non-shockable rhythms. In the ALS algorithm, shockable rhythms include pulseless VT and VF. In this case, the patient is unconscious with VT and a pulse can be felt.\n\nWhile amiodarone can be used to treat ventricular tachycardia, it would not be the most appropriate next step here, as this patient has signs of unstable VT, which must be managed with synchronised DC cardioversion in the first instance. Amiodarone is also used as part of the ALS algorithm for the treatment of patients with pulseless VT or VF. However, given the palpable pulse, synchronised DC cardioversion would be more appropriate here.\n\nMagnesium sulphate is the treatment of choice in broad-complex polymorphic tachycardia. Given this patient is unstable with a monomorphic VT, synchronised DC cardioversion would be the most appropriate next step.\n\nUnsynchronised DC cardioversion would be used in the treatment of patients with pulseless VT or VF. Given the palpable pulse, synchronised DC cardioversion would be more appropriate."

Patients requiring more than 2 antianginals should be considered for reperfusion therapies, with the addition of a third drug only if the patient is not a candidate for PCI or CABG.\n\nIn this case, the patient has first-degree heart block with relative bradycardia and calcium channel blockers would be contraindicated. NICE recommends the addition of either ranolazine, nicorandil, ivabradine or a long-acting nitrate. Sick sinus syndrome would be a contraindication to ivabradine and calcium channel blocker. In addition, alcohol excess and recent decompensation, despite current abstinence, is likely to have resulted in liver dysfunction, an absolute contraindication to ranolazine . Nicorandil is only contraindicated in LV failure and cardiogenic shock, acting as a potassium channel opener, and is thus the only appropriate anti-anginal in this scenario."

Revascularisation has not been shown to reduce mortality or the rate of myocardial infarction in such patients. However, sub-group analysis of randomised controlled trials suggests some benefit for the above outcomes over medical therapy. Therefore, ESC guidelines recommend offering revascularisation to patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischaemia in &gt; 10 % of the left ventricle.

He is otherwise well with no recent illness or significant past medical history.\n\nObservations are all within normal range and an ECG performed is shown below.\n\nWhat is the patient's most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\n- a) Brugada syndrome\n- b) Dilated cardiomyopathy\n- c) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy\n- d) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)\n- e) Wellen's syndrome\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThis patient has presented with features in keeping with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The condition is due to a genetic defect that causes a disorder of the cardiac muscle and, although patients can be asymptomatic, it is the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Patients who do present with symptoms typically experience exertional dyspnoea, angina and syncopal episodes, commonly following or during exertion. ECG findings are of left ventricular hypertrophy, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion and deep Q waves. On this patient's ECG widespread T wave inversion can be seen, especially in lead I &amp; II as well as nonspecific ST-segment changes in V2 &amp; 3. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cardiac echo and management is dependant on the extent of obstruction and patient symptoms.\n\nBrugada syndrome is another genetic cardiac disorder however unlike HOCM it results in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death however it is not always associated with exertion or exercise. There are several types of Brugada syndrome, each with variations seen on ECG. However, the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as the Brugada sign.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial and characterised by progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Presentation is normal with worsening biventricular failure including peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Syncope episodes are rare and symptoms are not fluctuant, as seen in this patient. ECG abnormalities are those associated with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with conduction delays (e.g. LBBB), left axis deviation and poor R wave progression.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), is a result of a genetic defect affecting the desmosomes of the myocardium. ARVD results in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, mainly affecting the right ventricle. The condition leads to hypokinetic areas of the ventricle wall and myocardium fibrofatty replacement with which results in associated arrhythmias. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncope, and potentially sudden cardiac death however ECG findings are of T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3 and of right bundle branch block which are not present in this case.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic-like symptoms .\n\nA 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with palpitations. An ECG confirms atrial fibrillation. His CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2 and he is commenced on bisoprolol and edoxaban.\n\nHe is referred and attends for catheter ablation, which he undergoes successfully. Post-procedure ECG confirms sinus rhythm.\n\nHe is followed up 4 weeks later in the clinic and a repeat ECG confirms the maintenance of sinus rhythm.\n\nWhat is the best course of action at this stage?\n\n- a) Continue edoxaban for a further 4 weeks then stop\n- b) Continue edoxaban for a further 8 weeks then stop\n- c) Continue edoxaban long-term\n- d) Discontinue edoxaban\n- e) Switch to aspirin\n\nPatients who've had a catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation still require longterm anticoagulation as per their CHA 2 DS2 -VASc score\n\nThe correct answer is continue edoxaban long-term . Although the ablation has been successful and rhythm control has been achieved, patients in this setting have the same stroke risk as those remaining in atrial fibrillation.\n\nAnticoagulation should, therefore, be continued long-term."

A normal QTc interval for women should lie between 350-460ms. Patients with a prolonged QTc interval are at particular risk of developing critical arrhythmias such as Torsades de pointes (a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). It is therefore extremely important to avoid drugs that may prolong the QTc interval further . Ondansetron is a type of 5HT-3 receptor antagonist that is associated with QTc interval prolongation and should\n\n## therefore be avoided.\n\nCodeine is a weak opioid analgesic with common side effects of nausea, drowsiness and constipation. It does not prolong the QTc interval.\n\nCyclizine is a H1-receptor antagonist. Side effects of cyclizine include urinary retention, dry mouth, and blurred vision. Prolongation of the QTc interval is not a common feature of this medication.\n\nHyoscine butylbromide is used in the treatment of gastric spasm. It is an anticholinergic agent and is, therefore, contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, urinary retention and gastrointestinal obstruction. It does not prolong the QTc interval.\n\nOmeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor used in the treatment of gastritis and gastro-oesophageal bleeding. Complications include electrolyte disturbances (e.g. hypomagnesaemia) and increased risk of Clostridium dificile infections, acute interstitial nephritis, but not prolongation of the QTc interval."

There is no past medical history of note other than the use of Microgynon 30 (a combined oral contraceptive pill). For the past 4-5 days the patient has experienced shortness-of-breath and a central chest pain which is worse when she coughs.

This combination of symptoms is however only found in less than 20% of cases. As PE is a potentially life-threatening condition it is important to be aware of the wide variety of symptoms and signs that may accompany cases.\n\nA lot of patients who develop a PE have risk factors. There is one present in this case - combined oral contraceptive pill use. Tachycardia is also a common sign.\n\nIt would be unusual to develop an asthma attack with no previous history of asthma. Occasional wheezes are a relatively common finding in patients following a pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe ECG shows a sinus tachycardia and a partial S1Q3T3 - the S wave is not particularly convincing."

It is common post-MI following the reperfusion of an ischaemic myocardium. AIVR is usually self- limiting and therefore treatment is not necessary, especially as the patient is asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable with a normal heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nArranging for urgent repeat PCI is unnecessary as there is no indication of new/further ischaemic damage or an ischaemic event having occurred. AIVR is due to an ectopic rhythm and therefore PCI is of no value.\n\nPacemaker insertion is not required as AIVR is due to a benign ectopic rhythm and therefore pacemaker insertion would not remove the cause.

She feels very conscious about its appearance but denies any pain, itch or discomfort.\n\nOn examination, she appears well. The area in question appears as Xanthelasma around eyes.\n\nGiven the likely diagnosis, which of the following would be an appropriate management option?\n\n- a) Topical emollient\n- b) Topical hydrocortisone\n- c) Topical ketoconazole\n- d) Topical trichloroacetic acid\n- e) Urgent referral to secondary care\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThe photo above demonstrates xanthelasma - high lipid levels leading to soft yellow/orange plaques, periorbitally. They are not of clinical concern - except for the underlying lipid profile which should be investigated and treated accordingly. They can be left alone, but if patients are keen for treatment, a commonly used option is topical trichloroacetic acid.\n\nTopical emollient is unnecessary. This will not help to alleviate the appearance of the xanthelasma.\n\nTopical hydrocortisone is inappropriate here. As a steroid, this would not help to reduce the appearance of xanthelasma.\n\nTopical ketoconazole is also inappropriate. This is an antifungal and may be used for seborrhoeic dermatitis, which would instead present with dry, flaky skin and erythema - not yellow/orange plaques.\n\nAn urgent referral to a hospital is also unwarranted. Xanthelasma is of no clinical concern and requires no further investigation.\n\nA 68-year-old man presents with occasional lightheadedness over the past few weeks.

He is currently on medications including aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and vildagliptin.\n\nObservations are as below:\n\n- \uf0b7 BP 140/85 mmHg\n- \uf0b7 Heart rate 74 bpm\n- \uf0b7 Respiratory rate 16/min\n- \uf0b7 Oxygen saturation 98% on room air\n\nAn ECG was subsequently carried out shows Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate management option?\n\n- a) Discharge him and recommend a follow up ECG\n- b) Give atropine\n- c) Intravenous infusion of isoproterenol\n- d) Refer for cardiac resynchronisation therapy\n- e) Review his medications\n\nThe correct answer is review his medications .\n\nThe ECG findings demonstrate a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. This is characteristic of a 2nd-degree Mobitz 1 or Wenckebachtype block. This is usually a relatively benign rhythm with a low risk of progression to higher-degree blocks. This patient has symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness, coupled with stable vital signs. As long as there is no hemodynamic compromise, there is no need for urgent intervention. Searching for a reversible cause should be the first step. This patient is on bisoprolol, a known cause of AVN block, and should be reviewed.\n\nDischarge him and recommend a follow up ECG is incorrect. It is indicated if the patient is asymptomatic with a first or 2nd-degree Mobitz 1 heart block. This patient has symptoms of light-headedness and dizziness, which require intervention.\n\nGive atropine is incorrect. Atropine is generally indicated for acute symptomatic AVN block with bradycardia and adverse features (heart failure, shock, syncope, myocardial ischaemia). There are no adverse features in this case.\n\nIntravenous infusion of isoproterenol is also an incorrect answer. Reviewing any potential causes should be the initial approach for symptomatic hemodynamically stable patients. IV isoproterenol is indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients who fail to respond to transcutaneous pacing. Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, it is important to avoid it if possible, due to the potential development of ischemic chest pain.\n\nRefer for cardiac resynchronisation therapy is incorrect. Cardiac resynchronisation can be beneficial if there is heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35% and a widened QRS (e.g. left bundle branch block) complex on the ECG. It has no role in the management of the AVN block."

The QRS complexes are narrow and clear 'p' waves cannot be seen before each complex. This is in keeping with a tachyarrhythmia, most likely secondary to atrial fibrillation however the specific cause is not relevant as urgent synchronised cardioversion is required in any unstable patient presenting with a tachyarrhythmia. Cardioversion should be carried out in a resuscitation setting, with procedural sedation if possible. Other indications of instability in arrhythmias include evidence of myocardial ischaemia and heart failure. Following cardioversion, further management is based on the QRS complexes (narrow vs broad) and the rhythm (regular vs irregular).\n\nAdenosine is the treatment of choice in patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), which may be the underlying diagnosis in this case, however, it should be used in hemodynamically stable patients only. As the patient is unstable cardioversion is required.\n\nMetoprolol is an IV beta-blocker and, although it can be used in some tachyarrhythmias, this patient is unstable and requires urgent electrical cardioversion. IV beta-blockers can be used in stable patients with tachyarrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation) for rate control as so long as they have an adequate systolic blood pressure and there are no other contraindications (e.g. asthma).\n\nPacemaker insertion is used in the management of bradycardia arrhythmias and does not have a role in acute arrhythmias causing compromise.\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention is used in the management of myocardial infarction (MI). Although the patient has some risk factors, and cocaine use can induce an MI, it is unlikely to be the underlying issue in this case with the patient not reporting chest pain symptoms and no clear evidence of ST-elevation seen on the ECG."

In addition, she has a number of minor criteria, including fever, vascular events (stroke), immunological events (splinter haemorrhages, renal impairment secondary to glomerulonephritis).\n\nDespite starting on appropriate empirical treatment she appears to have an ongoing infection from her blood tests, and her ECG demonstrates a prolonged PR interval which may be reflective of an enlarging aortic abscess disrupting the atrioventricular node, which is an indication for referral for cardiothoracic surgery in infective endocarditis .\n\nOther surgical indications include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Heart failure: valve obstruction resulting in pulmonary oedema or shock, severe acute regurgitation\n- \uf0b7 Uncontrolled infection: abscess, false aneurysm, persisting fever and positive blood cultures for greater than 10 days despite appropriate antibiotics, multiresistant microorganisms\n- \uf0b7 Prevention of embolism: large vegetations resulting in one or more embolic episodes despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, or other predictors of complications eg. heart failure.\n\nShe has a penicillin-resistant streptococci, according to the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines, should be treated with vancomycin and gentamicin, so options (a) and (c) are incorrect. Streptococcus Bovis bacteraemia is associated with bowel malignancy, and a colonoscopy should be arranged to rule out malignancy, however, the worsening PR prolongation takes priority and should be managed first.\n\nAn urgent trans-oesophageal echocardiogram may be useful to evaluate the size of the aortic abscess, however, it would not change management as this patient needs to be referred to the cardiothoracic surgeons as there is already evidence of enlarging vegetation."

An initial echo demonstrated significant raised pulmonary arterial pressures of 77 mmHg, she undergoes a left and right heart catheter with results as follows:\n\n|                 |           | Oxygen saturations   |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Right atrium    | 8 mmHg    | 71%                  |\n| Right ventricle | 39/8 mmHg | 71%                  |\n\n| Pulmonary artery   | 45/12 mmHg   | 71%   |\n|--------------------|--------------|-------|\n| Capillary wedge    | 20 mmHg      | 93%   |\n| Left ventricle     | 165/11 mmHg  | 93%   |\n| Aorta              | 90/58 mmHg   |       |\n\n## What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Aortic stenosis\n- b) Mitral stenosis\n- c) Aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis\n- d) Aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension\n- e) Aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, pulmonary hypertension\n\n## Correct answer is e.\n\nThe key to questions regarding saturations and cardiac catheters is to spot the 'step-up' in oxygen saturation and abnormalities in gradients across valves. There are no 'step-ups' in oxygen saturations, demonstrating no shunts. However, you will note that the pulmonary arterial pressure is greater than the normal one-fifth of systolic measurements; hence pulmonary hypertension is present. In addition, there is a greater than 25mmHg gradient across the aorta valve, demonstrating moderate aortic stenosis. Lastly, the capillary wedge pressure is equivalent to the left atrial pressure, which should also be the same as the left ventricular diastolic pressure. A normal mitral valve expects less than 5mmHg pressure difference. Using these inferences, the mitral valve gradient is calculated by the capillary wedge pressure of 20mmHg (same as the left atrial pressure) minus the diastolic left ventricular pressure of 11mmHg: the 9mmHg difference thus also demonstrates mitral stenosis.\n\nA 65-year-old man is reviewed in the outpatient cardiology clinic and reports palpitations and fatigue when carrying out normal household tasks. He has a history of heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 41%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He takes bisoprolol 10mg once daily, ramipril 10mg once daily and uses a tiotropium bromide inhaler. Observations:\n\n- \uf0b7 Heart rate 88 beats per minute\n- \uf0b7 Blood pressure 145/82 mmHg\n- \uf0b7 Respiratory rate 18/minute\n- \uf0b7 Oxygen saturations 96% on room air (95% on exertion)\n\nOn examination, the pulse is regular.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management?\n\n- a) Add a long-acting beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroid\n- b) Add digoxin\n- c) Add ivabradine\n- d) Add spironolactone\n- e) Increase the dose of bisoprolol\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nOffer a mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist, in addition to an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and beta-blocker, to people who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction if they continue to have symptoms of heart failure\n\nAdd spironolactone is correct. The patient reports palpitations and fatigue on minimal exertion. These symptoms suggest symptomatic heart failure rather than worsening COPD. This is reaffirmed by the normal SpO2 results following exertion. In a patient that is on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor, the correct next step is to add spironolactone.\n\nAdd a long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid is incorrect. Symptoms of palpitations and fatigue are more suggestive of symptomatic heart failure rather than COPD where wheezing and shortness of breath would be more typical. Therefore adjusting his COPD inhaler regimen is incorrect.\n\nAdd digoxin is incorrect. Digoxin is indicated in the management of symptomatic heart failure (especially in the context of co-existent atrial fibrillation) but only after other medications such as spironolactone have been initially trialled. This patient is not in AF.\n\nAdd ivabradine is incorrect. This is a 3rd line option for those patients with an ejection fraction &lt; 35% and a heart rate &gt; 75.\n\nIncrease the dose of bisoprolol is incorrect. 10mg is the maximum dose of bisoprolol that is recommended for heart failure."

She reports that her symptoms have worsened over the last 8 hours and her palpitations are now persistent and are associated with lightheadedness. She has no past medical history of note and takes no regular medications.\n\nOn examination, she appears clammy and warm to the touch. Her heart rate is 72 beats/min with a blood pressure of 125/83mmHg.\n\nAn ECG is taken (as shown below):\n\n\n\n## What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Accelerated junctional rhythm\n- b) Atrial flutter\n- c) Normal sinus rhythm\n- d) Supraventricular tachycardia\n- e) Wolff-Parkinson white syndrome\n\nThis patient has Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome a pre-excitation syndrome that causes clinical features of palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain and in severe cases collapse and shock, including cardiac arrest. Wolff-Parkinson White is caused by an accessory pathway conducting impulses from the sinoatrial node to the ventricles giving rise to an atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia. ECG features include a shortened PR interval, left axis deviation or right axis deviation (depending on the location of the accessory pathway) and a widened QRS complex from the 'delta' wave (a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex). The delta wave can be seen in this patient's ECG, along with a shortened PR interval.\n\nAccelerated junctional rhythm is incorrect. Accelerated junctional rhythm is when the atrioventricular node conducts at a faster rate than the sinoatrial node. This gives rise to an ECG with appearances of a narrow complex rhythm, with a ventricular rate between 60-100 beats/min. Retrograde P waves can be seen. Causes include digoxin toxicity, beta-blockers and myocardial ischaemia.\n\nAtrial flutter is incorrect. Atrial flutter is an irregular supraventricular arrhythmia. Although it can cause similar symptoms to those experienced by the patient, a characteristic ECG finding is a saw-tooth appearance of the baseline of the ECG which is not seen here.\n\nNormal sinus rhythm is incorrect. Although the patient's rhythm is sinus with QRS complexes following a P wave. There are clear delta waves preceding the QRS complexes that are consistent with Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome.\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is incorrect. SVT is caused by a re-entry circuit within the atrioventricular node. This is in contrast to atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia which is caused by an accessory conducting pathway (e.g. Wolff-\n\nParkinson White syndrome). Symptoms are similar to this patient's presentation with palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain that may be exacerbated by caffeine or alcohol. However, the presence of a delta wave is more suggestive of an accessory conducting pathway, making supraventricular tachycardia."

The pain is located in the centre of his chest and made worse by exertion. According to the NICE guidelines, which is the most appropriate investigation?\n\n- a) Treadmill ECG\n- b) Trans-thoracic echocardiogram\n- c) CT-coronary angiography\n- d) Nuclear perfusion stress test\n- e) Diagnostic coronary angiography\n\nThe correct answer is CT-coronary angiography . According to the NICE guidelines (CG95), a CT coronary angiogram should be offered as the first-line investigation for patients with typical or atypical angina symptoms and who are in the intermediate risk group (10-29% 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease). This patient fits into this category due to his age, sex, and lack of other risk factors. The CT coronary angiogram will help visualise the coronary arteries and identify any significant stenosis.\n\nTreadmill ECG was once a common initial test for angina but it has now been superseded by more accurate tests such as CT coronary angiography. Treadmill ECG can have false positives and negatives, hence it is not recommended as a firstline investigation by NICE.\n\nA Trans-thoracic echocardiogram is useful in assessing cardiac function but it does not directly visualise the coronary arteries so it would not be appropriate in this case. It may be used in conjunction with other tests if there are signs of heart failure or valvular heart disease.\n\nNuclear perfusion stress test involves injecting a radioactive tracer and then imaging the heart under stress and at rest. While this test can identify areas of myocardium that are under-perfused due to significant stenosis, it exposes patients to radiation, is more expensive than CT angiography and does not directly image the coronaries. Hence, it is usually reserved for cases where other investigations are contraindicated or inconclusive.\n\nFinally, Diagnostic coronary angiography , while considered the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease, is invasive and carries risks such as bleeding, stroke or kidney damage from contrast dye. As per NICE guidelines, it should only be used when non-invasive tests are inconclusive or contraindicated or when immediate revascularisation is being considered."

The differential is therefore between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with bundle branch block (BBB) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Distinguishing between VT and SVT with BBB can be challenging. The presence of RBBB and RAD favours a diagnosis of SVT with BBB. If you are unsure of the diagnosis, it is always safer to assume the the patient has VT and treat accordingly.\n\nThe absence of P waves should make you consider a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) with BBB, however the regular rhythm precludes this diagnosis. In SVT, the P waves are often buried within the QRS complex.\n\nThe normal QTc and regular rhythm precludes the diagnosis of Torsades de pointes (TdP)."

Pacemaker insertion is the most appropriate option.\n\nThe most common pacing mode is DDD. This means that there is d ual pacing and sensing of both the atrial and ventricles.\n\nDDD pacemaker is the correct option. 'D' stands for dual and means that the pacemaker senses and paces both atrial and ventricular activity. Mobitz type II is a high-degree atrioventricular block, this means that the pacemaker needs to sense both atrial and ventricular activity e.g. if there is a non-conducted p-wave (as in Mobitz type II) the pacemaker senses atrial activity, senses ventricular nonactivity, and subsequently stimulates a ventricular response.\n\nVVI pacemaker is incorrect. A VVI pacemaker is a single lead pacemaker that senses and paces the ventricles only. The 'I' stands for 'inhibition' and indicates that if the pacemaker senses ventricular activity it inhibits its pacing output. VVI pacemakers, also known as ventricular demand pacemakers, are commonly used for ventricular bradycardia such as atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.\n\nAAI pacemaker is incorrect. An AAI pacemaker is a single lead pacemaker that senses and paces the atria only. The 'I' stands for 'inhibition' and indicates that if the pacemaker senses atrial activity it inhibits its pacing output. It is used only for patients with sinus node dysfunction.\n\nTranscutaneous pacing would be used for patients who were unstable as a stopgap measure whilst they awaited pacemaker insertion. This would not be appropriate in this case as we have a stable and well patient.\n\nAblation is used to prevent aberrant electrical signalling from causing arrhythmias.

Complete heart block soon after an inferior MI is not uncommon, and usually resolves without the need for intervention. The key to this question is the fact that the patient is asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. In view of this fact, it is sensible to closely monitor and observe on the assumption that given enough time postreperfusion she will return to sinus rhythm.

Given he has now developed atrial fibrillation on a background of severe mitral regurgitation he should be referred for consideration of a valve repair or replacement.\n\nCommence bisoprolol is incorrect. The patient in this scenario has a preserved ejection fraction as indicated by the echo findings.

Her examination reveals a diminished radial pulse in the left arm and a systolic blood pressure difference in the upper extremities of 14 mmHg. A bruit is auscultated along the left upper extremity. Dopplers of the upper extremities indicate a stenotic area along the subclavian that is later confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). She is diagnosed with subclavian steal syndrome. Laboratory tests reveal normocytic normochromic anaemia, elevated CRP and ESR, negative ANA and ANCA, and all other laboratory tests are within normal range.\n\nOf the following, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Fibromuscular dysplasia\n- b) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n- c) Takayasu arteritis\n- d) Giant cell arteritis\n- e) Wegener's granulomatosis\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nThis patient likely has Takayasu arteritis which is essentially a chronic vasculitis primarily of the aorta and its branches. These patients can present in a variety of different ways depending on the vessels affected, however, they all typically have a prodrome of systemic symptoms including fatigue, weight loss and low-grade fevers prior to developing any vascular complaints. From a pathology standpoint biopsies of vessels are very similar to giant cell and are typically not performed. There are 6 criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu.\n\nPresence of 3 of the 6 has 90% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis:\n\n- \uf0b7 1. Age onset &lt;=40 years\n- \uf0b7 2. Claudication of the extremities\n- \uf0b7 3. Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries\n- \uf0b7 4. Difference of at least 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure between the arms\n- \uf0b7 5. Bruit over one or both subclavian arteries or the abdominal aorta\n- \uf0b7 6. Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or other causes.\n\nFibromuscular dysplasia typically affects the renal arteries leading to renal artery stenosis and hypertension, and it not accompanied by other systemic manifestations like fever and malaise. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic defect in type III collagen and can lead to aneurysms along with hyperelasticity of the skin and hypermobile joints, but other systemic manifestations are typically not present. Giant cell arteritis is most similar to Takayasu in pathology, however typically affects older patients and usually presents with headaches and tenderness over the temporal artery. Lastly, Wegener's is actually a small vessel vasculitis and its most common presenting symptoms include persistent rhinorrhoea, purulent/bloody nasal discharge, oral and/or nasal ulcers, polyarthralgias, myalgias, or sinus pain.

You also review his bloods:\n\n| Na +       | 136 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |\n|------------|--------------|---------------|\n| K +        | 4.7 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |\n| Urea       | 6.8 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |\n| Creatinine | 126 \u00b5mol/L   | (55 - 120)    |\n\nHe is currently on carvedilol 25 mg BD, enalapril 10 mg BD, bumetanide 2 mg BD, aspirin 75 mg, ivabradine 2.5 mg BD.\n\nWhat alteration to this gentleman's management could potentially decrease this gentleman's probability of being re-admitted?\n\n- a) Arrange cardiac resynchronisation therapy-pacemaker (CRT-P) implantation\n- b) Increase ivabradine\n- c) Increase bumetanide\n- d) Increase spironolactone\n- e) Initiate sacubitril/valsartan\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nCardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used in patients with a QRS duration of &gt;130 msec and LBBB morphology to improve symptomatology.\n\nThe European societies of cardiology (ESC) guidelines have highlighted the importance of cardiac resynchronisation in patients with heart failure. Evidence exists indicating the importance of implantation of such devices in patients with intraventricular delay with most studies focusing on the impact of left bundle branch block. The stronger evidence related CRT-P in such patients include left bundle branch block (LBBB) and QRS &gt;150 msec; however the presence of LBBB on its own provided that the QRS is longer than 120 msec is associated with improved mortality/morbidity. There is no evidence of benefit from CRT for patients with QRS &lt;120 msec, while the presence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) implies a worse disease state where CRT may not necessarily benefit such patients.\n\nThe possibility of altering medications in this case remains attractive however one should be aware of the potential of introducing detriment to the patient in doing so.\n\nThis patient is already tolerating a relatively slow heart rate therefore ivabradine could potentially cause further slowing.\n\nHe is borderline hypotensive with raised potassium (making the possibility of increasing spironolactone less favourable."

    "block": "## &gt;Question #63\n\nA medical opinion was sought from the obstetrics team regarding a 38-year-old 28 weeks pregnant lady. A routine blood pressure check revealed a blood pressure of 158/98 mmHg. Other than suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, her pregnancy had proceeded without complication. She specifically denied the presence of headaches, vomiting, any change in vision, abdominal pain, seizures or bleeding per vagina. She had noticed no change in the frequency of foetal movements, and her 20-week antenatal scan revealed the presence of a healthy foetus with a rate of growth within the expected range. Her past medical history was unremarkable; she was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. Her blood pressure at the booking antenatal appointment was 148/88 mmHg. Her sister suffered from preeclampsia during her pregnancy necessitating delivery by caesarean section. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed normal heart sounds, a JVP of 3cm and the absence of pedal oedema. Examination of the neurological system was unremarkable with normal reflexes, cranial nerve function and peripheral motor and sensory function. Urinalysis revealed no abnormality. What is the next best management step?\n\n- a) Commence ramipril\n- b) Commence labetalol\n- c) Commence indapamide\n- d) Commence magnesium sulphate\n- e) Transfer to high dependency unit to observe for signs of pre eclampsia\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nThis lady has pre-existing hypertension; her blood pressure at the antenatal booking clinic was elevated and continues to be elevated throughout (as opposed to gestational hypertension in which hypertension develops after 20 weeks). If untreated hypertension is associated with adverse maternal and foetal outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, cerebrovascular accidents and prematurity. There are no clinical features of preeclampsia, including notably the presence of proteinuria and peripheral oedema, and there is, therefore, no indication for admission to a high dependency unit or to commence magnesium sulphate. Of the remaining options, labetalol is the safest antihypertensive to use in pregnancy; methyldopa is an alternative. The usual first line ACE inhibitors are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #64\n\nA 52-year-old man is advised by his GP to attend hospital following a routine blood test demonstrating an increase in creatinine two weeks following a dose increase in his lisinopril. His lisinopril was increased from 5mg daily to 5mg twice a day.\n\nHe has a letter which demonstrates investigation results, shown below. He reports that home monitoring of blood pressure has shown his control to be better.\n\n21/11/2016\n\n6/11/2016\n\nNa +\n\n140 mmol/l\n\n138 mmol/l\n\n| K +         | 4.5 mmol/l   | 4.1 mmol/l   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Urea        | 5.5 mmol/l   | 5.4 mmol/l   |\n| Creatinin e | 110 \u00b5mol/l   | 92 \u00b5mol/l    |\n\nHow should his lisinopril be managed and monitored?\n\n- a) Continue lisinopril and repeat U&amp;Es in 1-2 weeks\n- b) Reduced the dose of lisinopril and repeat U&amp;Es in 1-2 weeks\n- c) Stop lisinopril and repeat U&amp;Es in 1-2 weeks\n- d) Stop lisinopril and arrange for an urgent out-patient imaging to exclude renal artery stenosis\n- e) Continue lisinopril and repeat U&amp;Es within 48 hours\n\nCorrect answer is a.\n\nThe correct answer is to continue lisinopril and repeat U&amp;Es in 1-2 weeks. Up to an increase in creatinine of 30% can be tolerated following the start or increase in an ACE-inhibitor such as lisinopril, but U&amp;Es should be repeated in 1-2 weeks. If the increase is greater than 30% then the ACE-inhibitor should be stopped.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #65\n\nA 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest tightness worse on inspiration. He informs you that over the past 3 days he has had a lowgrade temperature and a degree of myalgia. Prior to all this he had never experienced any chest tightness. He was given glyceryl trinitrate spray and aspirin in the ambulance, neither of which has made any difference.\n\nExamination is unremarkable; however you note that his temperature is 37.4\u00baC. He is a smoker and he informs you that his father, mother and paternal uncle all have had heart attacks around the age of 60. His bloods are the following:\n\nCreatinine\n\n95 \u00b5mol/L\n\n(55 - 120)\n\n| CRP               | 35 mg/L   | (< 5)   |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Troponin T (0hrs) | 580 ng/L  | (<14)   |\n| Troponin T (3hrs) | 625 ng/L  | (<14)   |\n| D-dimer           | Negative  |         |\n\nAn ECG is performed indicating sinus rhythm, no intraventricular delay and widespread ST elevations; you also notice was subtle PR depression. What treatment should be initiated in the case of this gentleman?\n\n- a) Arrange urgent angioplasty and potential revascularization\n- b) Load patient with aspirin and clopidogrel\n- c) Load patient with aspirin and ticagrelor\n- d) Prescribe ibuprofen TDS\n- e) Prescribe ibuprofen TDS and colchicine BD\n\n## Correct answer is e.\n\nFirst line management of acute pericarditis involves combination of NSAID and colchicine.\n\nThe history, examination and blood investigations are consistent with acute pericarditis/myopericarditis. The high troponin results indicate myocardial injury which in this case can be attributed to myopericarditis. Troponin is a marker of myocardial injury which can result due to primary ischaemia (plaque rupture or intraluminal coronary artery thrombus), ischaemia secondary to misbalance of supply and demand (tachy/bradyarrhythmias, aortic dissection or severe aortic valve disease, sepsis, severe anaemia or respiratory failure etc.) and myocardial injury not necessarily associated to ischaemia or multifactorial (such as myopericarditis, severe pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, cardiac stunning, cardiac surgery or intervention etc.) There is no strong, dynamic rise in the already high troponin level.\n\nThe fact that he is a smoker undeniably puts this gentleman at a higher risk of coronary event, however his blood tests, ECG and history point further to the direction of pericarditis. Given this, options 1, 2 and 3 which are associated with the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are wrong.\n\nThe current guidelines as per the European Society of cardiology state that the treatment of choice in such patients is a combination of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen) and colchicine (option 5) and do not advocate the use of a single agent, such as ibuprofen (option 4).\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #66\n\nA 27-year-old female presents with palpations and dizziness. She states that she has had a few episodes similar to this in the past and each time they have spontaneously resolved. On examination she has a blood pressure of 87/63 mmHg and a heart rate of 182bpm. An ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, no identifiable P waves, and a QRS of 136ms.\n\nYour senior decides to electrically cardiovert her. While the cardioversion is being prepared you instruct the patient to perform a vagal manoeuvre. Shortly after this she loses consciousness and goes into cardiac arrest.\n\nWhat is the most likely underlying disorder?\n\n- a) Torsades de Pointes\n- b) Atrial fibrillation\n- c) Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)\n- d) Monomorphic ventricular tachycardi\n- e) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nAV blocking drugs and vagal manoeuvres are absolutely contraindicated in patients with AF and pre-excitation\n\nThere are few arrhythmias, which can cause an irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia. These include irregular atrial arrhythmias with bundle branch block (e.g. atrial fibrillation), and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (including Torsades de Pointes). Another important group of conditions to be aware of include the pre-excitation syndromes.\n\nPre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an accessory pathway. This results in a broad QRS complex e.g. the slurred upstroke of QRS (delta wave) as is seen in WPW. When present with atrial fibrillation, the accessory pathway allows for rapid conduction directly to the ventricles bypassing the AV node. This results in an irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia.\n\nThe Valsalva manoeuvre increases the vagal tone resulting in AV node block. This promotes conduction of the atrial signals through the accessory pathway with a resultant increase in ventricular rate and possible degeneration into VT or VF, as is seen in this case.\n\nAV blocking drugs and vagal manoeuvres are absolutely contraindicated in patients with AF and pre-excitation. In a haemodynamically unstable patient, urgent synchronised DC cardioversion is required. Medical treatment options in a stable patient include procainamide, although DC cardioversion may be preferred. Procainamide is a class 1 anti-arrhythmic which preferentially blocks the accessory pathway.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #67\n\nA 47 year old woman presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. She has been progressively getting worse over two weeks and has now started to feel short of breath on rest. She is known to have mitral valve prolapse and is awaiting surgery but has so far not been given a date. She also has type 2 diabetes and depression. She takes metformin, sertraline and furosemide.\n\nOn examination, she looks unwell. She has bilateral crepitations with no wheeze on auscultation of her chest, a raised JVP, and a systolic murmur. A chest X-ray shows pulmonary oedema. She is treated with IV diuretics but remains breathless and hypoxic. Which type of ventilatory support would be most appropriate?\n\n- a) No ventilator support is appropriate\n- b) Negative pressure ventilation\n- c) Intubation\n- d) Bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP)\n- e) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nAcute heart failure not responding to treatment - consider CPAP\n\nThe correct answer is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This is a patient with a known mitral valve prolapse presenting with decompensation. It can be assumed that the lesion is significant as she is due to have surgery to repair it. She has developed signs of pulmonary oedema and she is not responding to treatment with diuretics. Vasodilators and opiates could be a plan of further medical management, but CPAP could help reduce pulmonary oedema. BIPAP would be appropriate in ventilatory failure in COPD, whilst negative pressure ventilation is more of historical treatment for polio.\n\nMitral valve prolapse has a prevalence of 2-3% in the population and the majority of cases will be asymptomatic. Risk factors for progression the severe disease include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Comorbidities: atrial fibrillation, left sided cardiac failure, hypertension and obesity.\n- \uf0b7 Echocardiogram findings: mitral leaflet thickness &gt;5mm, prolapse of the posterior leaflet, moderate or severe regurgitation.\n- \uf0b7 Stress echocardiogram findings: regurgitation during exercise but not at rest.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #68\n\nA 69 year-old male presents to the emergency department with central crushing chest pain which has been ongoing for 4 hours. It is associated with shortness of breath.\n\nBlood results are as follows:\n\n| Urea       | 7.8 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |\n|------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Creatinine | 134 \u00b5mol/L   | (55 - 120)    |\n| Troponin   | 8422 ng/L    | (< 15)        |\n\n## An ECG is performed:\n\n\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Anterolateral STEMI\n- b) Inferolateral STEMi\n- c) Myocarditis\n- d) Pericarditis\n- e) Posterior STEMI\n\nCorrect answer is b.\n\nThe ECG demonstrates ST elevation in the inferior ( II, III, and aVF) and lateral leads (V5-6) confirming a diagnosis of an inferolateral STEMI . ST depression in V12 is suggestive of an associated posterior infarction. This constellation of ECG abnormalities is typically produced by occlusion of the proximal circumflex artery.\n\nAnterolateral STEMI would present with ST elevation in the anterior (V1-V4) and lateral leads.\n\nPosterior STEMI presents with reciprocal changes in the anterior leads including horizontal ST depression and a dominant R wave in V2.\n\nBoth myocarditis and pericarditis present with global concave ST elevation. The troponin is usually normal in pericarditis and raised in myocarditis.\n\nDiscussImprove\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #69\n\nA 59 year-old woman is complaining of a six-hour history of chest pain and dizziness in the high-dependency unit. She underwent a mitral valve replacement five days ago and had some temporary trans-venous pacing wires removed earlier today.\n\nOn examination, she has oxygen saturations of 93% on 2 litres via nasal cannula, has a heart rate of 110/min, a blood pressure of 76/43mmHg, has a temperature of 37.9\u00baC, and is responsive to voice. She feels cool peripherally. An ECG is performed at the bedside which shows sinus rhythm with QRS complexes of alternating amplitude.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate management given the likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Electrolyte replacement\n- b) Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention\n- c) Pericardiocentesis\n- d) Prolonged course of antibiotics\n- e) Urgent temporary pacing wire insertion\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nElectrical alternans is suggestive of cardiac tamponade\n\nThis woman has clinical signs of cardiac tamponade which is confirmed by electrical alternans on ECG. Electrical alternans occurs due to the movement or 'swinging' of the heart within the pericardium as a result of the fluid present. This results in a variable amplitude of the QRS complex depending on the hearts proximity to the ECG leads. In this case, this was likely precipitated by a traumatic removal of trans-venous pacing wires causing bleeding into the pericardial space. As a result, she requires an urgent echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and subsequent pericardiocentesis or re-sternotomy to drain the blood. It is worth noting that her acute kidney injury is the result of poor cardiac output as a result of her tamponade.\n\nAlthough there are electrolyte abnormalities on this patient's blood tests that should be replaced, this is not likely to be the cause of her acute presentation. An arrhythmia post-operatively could cause a reduction in cardiac output however the ECG performed here demonstrates sinus rhythm and therefore electrolyte replacement would not reverse her current condition.\n\nAn acute coronary syndrome must be considered in cardiac post-operative patients complaining of chest pain however the electrical alternans on ECG with no remarkable ST changes to speak of is more consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Therefore, emergency percutaneous coronary intervention is not the most appropriate option here.\n\nA prolonged course of antibiotics may be employed if a diagnosis of infective endocarditis is suspected however this is not the case here for a variety of reasons. Firstly, infective endocarditis post-operatively is unlikely to present within 5 days. Furthermore, the electrical alternans on ECG is indicative of cardiac tamponade rather than infective endocarditis. Finally, although the patient has a fever and a raised CRP, these are common findings post-operatively due to the systemic inflammatory response to surgery and are not specific for infective endocarditis.\n\nArrhythmias are common in the post-operative period for patients who have undergone cardiac surgery, particularly valve surgery, however, this patient is in sinus rhythm at an acceptable rate. Therefore, as this patient's pathology is mechanical rather than electrical, urgent temporary pacing wire insertion will not help with her current issue.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #70\n\nA 32 year-old woman is investigated for persistent malaise, fever, headaches and raised inflammatory markers. She was diagnosed with Raynaud's syndrome two years ago after complaining of cold hands. Her CRP level 64 mg/l.\n\nOn examination blood pressure is 82/65 mmHg in the right arm and 70/52 mmHg in the left arm. The heart rate is 74/min and a diastolic murmur is noted on ascultation of the heart.\n\nMagnetic resonance angiography is requested:\n\n\n\n## What is the most appropriate maangement?\n\n- a) Plasma exchange\n- b) Rituximab\n- c) Prednisolone\n- d) Cardiothoracic surgery referral\n- e) Intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThe magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrates stenoses of the supraaortic arteries, especially the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery with near-occlusion of the left vertebral artery. This findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #71\n\nA 64 year old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension attends the Emergency Department complaining of general malaise and feeling unwell. He had undergone successful primary coronary intervention (PCI) post myocardial infarction 5 weeks previously. He has a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 166/88 mmHg and the doctor notes a lacy reticular rash extending over his legs.\n\nHb\n\n14.2g/dl\n\nEosinophils\n\n1.3 * 10 9 /l\n\nWBC\n\n13.5 * 10 9 /l\n\nUrea\n\n8mmol/l\n\nCreatinine\n\n144\u00b5mol/l\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\n\n- a) Allergic rash to contrast\n- b) Infected femoral site\n- c) Cholesterol embolus\n- d) Infective endocarditis\n- e) Polyarteritis nodosa\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThis is a classic story for a cholesterol embolus post an invasive arterial procedure, whereby a plaque has been ruptured and there is lodging of debris in small/medium arteries causing mechanical occlusion, inflammation and end-organ damage. Patients may have the lacy reticular rash of livedo reticularlaris and this, together with acute renal failure and an eosinophilia should lead the clinician to consider this diagnosis.\n\nPatients tend to present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, weight loss and myalgia for weeks to months before developing end-organ damage or stroke.\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment is supportive.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #72\n\nA 33 year-old woman is brought into the Emergency Department by her husband. He tells you that she is abnormally drowsy and he has difficulty rousing her. She has a background of depression which is medicated by her General Practitioner, but is otherwise well.\n\nOn examination she is afebrile but has dry, warm skin. Her heart rate is 144bpm with a blood pressure of 108/90mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute and saturating at 92% on air. Her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is 12 (E3V4M5) and she appears agitated. Her pupils are dilated and she has hyperreflexia. Whilst examining her abdomen it is noted that she has a palpable bladder and bowel sounds are absent.\n\n## Investigations:\n\nArterial blood gas (ABG):\n\n| pH                  | 7.28       | (7.35-7.45)      |\n|---------------------|------------|------------------|\n| PCO2                | 7.3 kPa    | (4.9-6.1 kPa)    |\n| PO2                 | 10.1 kPa   | (10-13.1 kPa)    |\n| Bicarbonate (HCO3-) | 28 mmol/L  | (22-28 mmol/L)   |\n| Base Excess (BE)    | 3.1 mmol/L | (-2 to 2 mmol/L) |\n| Sodium              | 134 mmol/L | (135-145 mmol/L) |\n| Potassium           | 4.4 mmol/L | (3.5-5.5 mmol/L) |\n| Chloride            | 105 mmol/L | (95-110 mmol/L)  |\n| Lactate             | 2.2 mmol/L | (0.2-1.6 mmol/L) |\n| Glucose             | 5.3 mmol/L | (4-7 mmol/L)     |\n\nECG - Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, QTc 510ms.\n\nWhat is the most important next step in the management of this patient?\n\n- a) Synchronised DC cardioversion\n- b) Intravenous amiodarone\n- c) Intravenous magnesium sulphate\n- d) Intravenous lidocaine\n- e) Intravenous sodium bicarbonate\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nIV magnesium sulfate is used to treat torsades de pointes\n\nThis woman has had a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. In excess, TCAs can cause QT interval prolongation which can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. A polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia with a prolonged QT interval is characteristic of torsades de pointes. The treatment for this is intravenous magnesium sulphate.\n\nAs she currently has a stable blood pressure (systolic &gt; 90mmHg), DC cardioversion would not be appropriate at this stage. Intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine can be used to medically cardiovert a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but are not the treatment of choice in torsades de pointes.\n\nSodium bicarbonate is the first-line treatment of TCA overdose. However, in the presence of torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium sulphate is the more appropriate choice to give initially .\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #73\n\nA 64 year-old man presents with intermittent chest pains for the past three days. Whilst you are taking the history he complains of worsening pain and you arrange an ECG immediately:\n\nHe is tachycardic and sweaty with a blood pressure of 124/86mmHg. What does the ECG show?\n\n\n\n- a) Narrow complex tachycardia with ST elevation\n- b) Right bundle branch block with ST elevation\n- c) Left bundle branch block with ST elevation\n- d) Ventricular tachycardia with ST elevation\n- e) Posterior myocardial infarction\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nThe ECG shows left bundle branch block (LBBB). The relationship between new LBBB and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is complicated with many cardiologists ignoring the standard guidelines (both UK and US) to initiate reperfusion therapy due to the poor correlation seen in clinical practice between coronary lesions and standard LBBB. The Sgarbossa criteria have therefore been developed to evaluate whether new LBBB represents an ACS. In this particular ECG there is more ST elevation than is normally expected with LBBB indicating a likely ACS.\n\n## &gt;&gt;Question #74\n\nA 71-year-old patient presents to the Emergency Department with a two hour history of crushing central chest pain. He is known to have a history of ischaemic heart disease. The ECG shows the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 ST elevation greater in lead II than in lead III with abnormal Q waves in II, III, and aVF\n- \uf0b7 ST depression, tall, broad R waves and upright T waves in V1-3. Dominant R wave in V2\n- \uf0b7 ST elevation in V5-V6\n\nWhere is the lesion most likely to be?\n\n- a) Left anterior descending\n- b) Left circumflex\n- c) Right coronary artery\n- d) Left main stem\n- e) Posterior interventricular\n\nIschaemic changes in leads I, aVL +/- V5-6 - left circumflex\n\nThese are classical findings of a circumflex occlusion. The table below shows how the changes correspond to the cardiac anatomy:\n\n| ECG changes                                                                                | Component of infarction           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| ST elevation greater in lead II than in lead III with abnormal Q waves in II, III, and aVF | Inferior component of infarction  |\n| ST depression, tall, broad R waves and upright T waves in V1-3.

Her past medical history includes congestive cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and depression. Her regular medications include bisoprolol, digoxin, amlodipine, furosemide, and citalopram.\n\nRepeat digoxin levels are displayed below:\n\nDigoxin level\n\n1.1 ng/mL\n\n(0.7-2.0)\n\n\n\nWhich agent is responsible for the abnormalities displayed in her ECG?\n\n- a) Amlodipine\n- b) Bisoprolol\n- c) Citalopram\n- d) Digoxin\n- e) Furosemide\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThis woman's ECG displays 'scooped' ST depression in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 in the context of atrial fibrillation. This is a classical sign seen in the digoxin effect, the ECG changes that arise with digoxin within normal therapeutic levels. It is important to note that in digoxin toxicity, the most common dysrhythmias are supraventricular tachycardia with a slow ventricular response due to blocking of the AV node.\n\nWhilst calcium channel blockers can significantly disrupt the ECG, this is associated primarily with non-dihydropyridines such as verapamil or diltiazem, rather than dihydropyridines such as amlodipine which are less cardioselective.\n\nBisoprolol can give rise to bradycardia and PR prolongation on ECG but the ST changes observed here are consistent with the digoxin effect. Therefore, bisoprolol is incorrect.\n\nCitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and therefore can result in QT prolongation. The ST changes as described here are not consistent with this syndrome and therefore this is an incorrect answer.\n\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic that can result in hypokalemia and therefore flattened and inverted T waves. The ST segment in this ECG shows the classical 'scooped' appearance and therefore is more consistent with the digoxin effect rather than hypokalemia. Furosemide is therefore incorrect."

The discomfort can be so bad that he has to stop and rest for a few minutes after which he notices that his symptoms are improved. On occasions, he also gets the symptoms when he is shopping in the supermarket. He attributes this to overexerting himself and tries to rest on his shopping trolley while walking but does not seem to help. He has a 40-pack year smoking history and takes amlodipine for his blood pressure, and paracetamol and ibuprofen for lower back pain that has troubled him for years.\n\nPhysical examination reveals mild atrophy of his thigh and calf muscles bilaterally, in addition to shiny pale skin with significant hair loss throughout his lower limbs. His pedal pulses are bilaterally impalpable, and popliteal pulses are faint. Power in both lower limbs is normal throughout all movements, and he has normal patellar reflexes bilaterally and absent ankle reflexes. His Babinski reflex is downgoing on the left side and equivocal on the right side. A recently obtained ankle brachial pressure index test yielded a result of 0.70 on the right side and 0.95 on the left side. X-rays of his lumbar spine show evidence of joint space narrowing and osteophytes.\n\nWhich one of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?\n\n- a) MRI scan of lumbar spine\n- b) Check his HbA1c to screen for diabetes\n- c) Refer to vascular surgery for consideration of peripheral arterial stenting or bypass surgery\n- d) Starting him on duloxetine to manage his pain\n- e) Screen for coronary artery disease with ECG stress testing\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nIn patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms suggestive of claudication with an equivocal/borderline ankle brachial pressure index study result, the next best study is an ankle brachial pressure index after exercise\n\nThis gentleman has symptoms of claudication, in particular, vascular claudication. Although he does have a history of chronic back pain for which he takes analgesia, he is less likely to have neurogenic claudication compared to vascular claudication. An important discriminating factor between neurogenic claudication and vascular claudication is that patients with neurogenic claudication have symptoms on exertion that improve with manoeuvers such as leaning forward, and sitting down, whereas vascular claudication does not change with these manoeuvers and only improves with rest. In addition, his physical exam shows evidence of peripheral arterial disease characterised with muscle atrophy, shiny skin with hair loss and impalpable pedal pulses. Absent ankle jerk reflexes and equivocal Babinski reflexes can be normal variants and do not always indicate neurological pathology. This patient has rightly already undergone an ankle brachial pressure index assessment, and the results indicate a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. He is functionally impaired by his symptoms and so the next best step in his management would be to refer him to vascular surgery for consideration of treatment strategies which may include percutaneous interventions with stenting and/or surgical bypass.\n\nAlthough this patient has evidence of degenerative joint disease on his lumbar spine x-ray, his clinical presentation is not consistent with neurogenic claudication and so an MRI scan of his lumbar spine is not indicated.\n\nAlthough it is important to screen for and aggressively manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients with peripheral arterial disease, this in itself would not address the patient's symptoms or the disease course.\n\nThis patient's pain is most consistent with vascular claudication as opposed to neuropathic pain, for which an agent like duloxetine would be appropriate.\n\nAlthough individuals with peripheral arterial disease have a significant likelihood of having concomitant coronary disease, this patient is not complaining of angina or symptoms suggestive of coronary disease and so screening for this is not indicated. The next best step in managing this patient is to address and treat his symptoms related to his peripheral arterial disease."

He is currently hypotensive (90/45 mmHg) and tachycardic (120 beats per minute). You begin resuscitation using 0.9% saline, and send a cross match, group and save. What is the most appropriate treatment of this patients INR?\n\n- a) Fresh frozen plasma + stop warfarin\n- b) Vitamin K + stop warfarin\n- c) Prothrombin complex concentrates\n- d) Prothrombin complex concentrates + vitamin K + stop warfarin\n- e) Stop warfarin\n\nCorrect answer Is d.\n\nMajor bleeding - stop warfarin, give intravenous vitamin K 5mg, prothrombin complex concentrate\n\nThe nub of this question is the emergency management of haemorrhage in patients on warfarin. This patient has an INR greater than 8 and is actively bleeding. Therefore the answer is 4.\n\nPatients on warfarin have reduced levels of Factor X, IX, VII and II.

There are regular saw-toothed P waves at 300 bpm. There are regular QRS complexes at 150 bpm. Thus, this is atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response and 2:1 AV block.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is incorrect. Atrial fibrillation, unlike atrial flutter, is irregular with fibrillatory p waves caused by disorganised and chaotic atrial electrical activity. Contrary to atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is more amenable to cardioversion than medications.\n\nSinus tachycardia is incorrect. In sinus tachycardia, every P wave is followed by a QRS complex and the PR interval is &lt;200 ms. However, in this patient's ECG, not every p wave is followed by a QRS complex suggesting a 2:1 AV block. Moreover, the saw-toothed P waves at 300 bpm and prolonged PR interval is suggestive of atrial flutter.\n\nVentricular tachycardia is a broad complex tachycardia. The QRS complex here is narrow measuring &lt; 120 ms and regular at 150 bpm suggesting an Atrial Flutter with 2:1 block.\n\nWolff Parkinson White syndrome is incorrect.

The normal PR interval is 120200ms. A short PR interval is suggestive of a pre-excitation syndrome. Preexcitation syndromes occur due to an accessory pathway between the atria with the ventricles, resulting in early depolarisation of the ventricles and a tendency for tachyarrhythmias. Pre-excitation through the accessory pathway results in a short PR interval.\n\nThe normal QRS width (normal width &lt;120ms) precludes the diagnosis of WolffParkinson-White syndrome which is characterised by a wide QRS with a slurred upstroke (delta wave). The normal QRS also rules out ventricular tachycardia.\n\nThe diagnosis is therefore Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome (LGL) which is a preexcitation syndrome of the heart characterised by a short PR interval and normal QRS width.\n\nDiscuss (6)Improve"

There is no history of a change in diet or detergents and he has no known allergies. His past medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation.\n\nOn examination, there is a purplish discolouration of his hands up to his elbows bilaterally. His face and scalp are mildly erythematous. There is no blistering or crusting.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be responsible for this patient's presentation?\n\n- a) Aspirin\n- b) Digoxin\n- c) Indapamide\n- d) Metformi\n- e) Ramipril\n\nCorrect answer Is c.\n\nThiazides may cause photosensitivity\n\nThis patient has drug-induced photosensitivity, a skin reaction secondary to UV radiation causing expected burns or dermatitis in patients taking photosensitising medications. Drugs which cause phototoxicity include: antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones), NSAIDs, diuretics, sulfonylureas, antipsychotics as well as amiodarone, quinine and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical features of photosensitivity can vary according to the medication taken as well as the type of reaction. Some reactions may be phototoxic whilst others are photoallergic. A phototoxic reaction results from direct damage mediated by UV activation of the photosensitising agent. These reactions can appear within minutes to hours after exposure and appears as a sunburn reaction with reddening and swelling. Rarely, the skin may change pigmentation (e.g. blue-green discoloration seen with amiodarone). In severe reactions, blisters and vesicles may be seen. Other symptoms may include itch, as seen in this scenario. Thiazides typically cause a phototoxic reaction. In contrast, a photoallergic reaction is a cell-mediated response. These are less common and present as an eczematous, itchy skin reaction within 24-72 hours after exposure to sunlight. Unlike phototoxic reactions, photoallergic reactions are capable of spreading to areas that have not been exposed to sunlight. The treatment of drug-induced photosensitivity is to avoid the trigger, if possible. If the medication is essential to be taken then protective measures should be taken including sunscreen or protective clothing.\n\nIn toxic doses, digoxin is capable of causing side effects including arrhythmias, dizziness, yellow or green visual changes and skin reactions. However, they do not commonly cause photosensitivity. If there are any concerns regarding digoxin toxicity, a digoxin level can be taken with the therapeutic window ranging between 0.7ng/mL and 2.0ng/mL.\n\nAspirin is a common cause of acute or chronic urticaria. However, it does not cause photosensitivity.\n\nMetformin and ramipril do not commonly cause a rash or skin discolouration. In rare cases, patients may have an allergic reaction to these medications which results in the eruption of urticaria and, in extreme cases, lip and tongue swelling and airway compromise. However, they do not cause photosensitivity."

The differential for a Marfanoid body habitus is wide and includes Marfan's syndrome and homocystinuria.\n\nHomocystinuria is correct. The patient has several clinical features associated with homocystinuria (e.g. Marfanoid body habitus, recurrent DVTs, learning disability and ectopia lentis). It is important to remember that the ectopia lentis in homocystinuria is inferonasal, in contrast to the superior-temporally dislocation associated with Marfan's syndrome.\n\nEctopia lentis syndrome is incorrect. Ectopia lentis syndrome is an inherited connective tissue condition that shares some of the features of Marfan's syndrome - particularly lens dislocation of the eye. However, patients with ectopia lentis syndrome do not have any vascular complications associated with Marfan's syndrome. Patients with ectopia lentis syndrome do not have any of the other features demonstrated in this case.\n\nEhlers danlos syndrome is incorrect. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are generally characterised by joint hypermobility, joint instability and dislocations, scoliosis, and other joint deformities. In the rarer types of EDS, there is also a weakness of specific tissues that can lead, for example, to major gum and dental disease, eye disease, cardiac valve and aortic root disorders, and life-threatening abdominal organ, uterine, or blood vessel rupture. Thrombotic complications and lens dislocation are rare in this condition making it a less likely diagnosis.\n\nMarfan's syndrome is incorrect.

Two hours after being admitted to CCU, he complained of nausea and vomited twice, which settled after being prescribed cyclizine by a passing medical senior house officer. Thirty minutes afterwards, you are asked to see the patient as the patient has become increasingly short of breath. He complains of no new chest pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating or palpitations.

Cyclizine is a H1 receptor antagonist and anticholinergic, resulting in systemic hypertension and inducing tachycardia. It can aggravate a fragile myocardium into acute failure and is hence not recommended by NICE in patients with ACS or severe heart failure1. In this patient, the lack of chest pain or ST elevation on ECG makes acute in-stent thrombosis or a further ACS episode unlikely. The patient is hypertensive instead of hypotensive, with no mention of low voltage on ECG, making cardiac tamponade an unlikely cause.\n\n1.

In this scenario, the patient developed cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia and cool skin) with a holosystolic murmur following a complicated inferior wall STEMI (as denoted by complete heart block on ECG). The differential diagnoses include acute mitral regurgitation (MR) and acute ventricular septal rupture (VSR). A holosystolic murmur heard over the left sternal edge suggests an acute VSR. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram is warranted to delineate the site and extent of the defect. This diagnostic step should be performed concurrently with medical therapy, preceding an immediate surgical consultation.\n\nCT coronary angiography is not appropriate in this context. Although CT coronary angiography can be useful for patients with suspected stable angina, in this case, where acute VSR is likely following a well-established inferior wall STEMI, echocardiography will provide rapid and precise information about the lesion that will inform surgical management decisions.\n\nCardiac MRI would not be suitable in this setting. Although it can sometimes provide superior detail compared to echocardiography, its longer scan times, limited availability, and inadequacy for haemodynamically unstable patients render it a less favourable choice for imaging in this emergency.\n\nImmediate surgical consultation plays a pivotal role in managing both acute MR and VSR; however, it should be preceded by a detailed lesion assessment using echocardiography to inform subsequent surgical intervention.\n\nRe-transfer to the catheter lab would not benefit this patient. Such a step may be considered if re-infarction is suspected. Given that the clinical picture points towards an acute VSR post-myocardial infarction, echocardiographic evaluation remains crucial for diagnosis, and coronary angiography will not diagnose such a complication."

Wellen's syndrome is the critical ischaemia of the left anterior descending artery. Patients typically have a history of chest pain and ECG findings include biphasic T waves in the anterior leads or deep symmetrical T wave inversion in leads I and aVL associated with 1mm ST elevation in the chest leads. These can be seen in this patient's ECG.\n\nBrugada syndrome is incorrect. Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited cardiovascular disease. It can be asymptomatic and lead to sudden cardiac death. ECG changes consistent with Brugada syndrome include convex STsegment elevation &gt; 2mm in at least 1 of V1-V3 that is followed by T wave inversion. A partial right bundle branch block may also be seen. Sometimes, a patient may have an appearance of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). However, following the administration of flecainide, these ST-segment changes may appear.\n\nHypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is incorrect. HOCM is an autosomal dominant inherited condition resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy with decreased cardiac compliance and ultimately decreased cardiac output. Most cases can be asymptomatic. However, symptoms include exertional dyspnoea or chest pain, syncope and sudden cardiac death. Given the family history of sudden cardiac death, HOCM is a reasonable differential. However, ECG features of HOCM include features of left ventricular hypertrophy (eg increased R wave height), deep Q waves and non-specific ST segment changes that are not seen in this patient's ECG.\n\nPosterior myocardial infarction is incorrect. A posterior myocardial infarction causes ECG findings such as a dominant R wave in V2, and horizontal ST depression and broad R waves in V1-V3. Although the patient has cardiacsounding chest pain, their ECG findings do not match those that we see here, making this answer incorrect.\n\nPulmonary embolus with right heart strain is incorrect. Classic findings of a pulmonary embolus include sinus tachycardia and the less common S1Q3T3 finding. However, in more significant disease, patients may exhibit features of right heart strain secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Right heart strain appears as ischaemic changes (including deep T wave inversion) in the right-sided leads of the heart. The history here is not suggestive of a pulmonary emboli and does not explain the biphasic T waves seen in V1 and V2."

Her potassium has since normalised.\n\nHer latest echo reveals an ejection fraction of 25%. Her ECG is sinus rhythm Her last BNP was 1000 pg/ml.\n\nShe is currently taking senna, ramipril 10mg, aspirin 75m, frusemide 40mg bd, simvastatin 40mg, and spironolactone 50mg.\n\nHer observations at clinic are:\n\n- oxygen saturations: 94% on room air\n\n- \uf0b7\n\n- \uf0b7 blood pressure: 126/66 mmHg\n\n- \uf0b7 heart rate: 84/min\n\nWhich additional medication would be beneficial?\n\n- a) Ivabradine\n- b) Bisoprolol\n- c) Digoxin\n- d) Diltiazem\n- e) Atenolol\n\n## Correct answer is b.\n\nThis patient is already taking some prognostically beneficial medications; ACE inhibitor and aldosterone antagonist. The additional of a beta blocker would be a beneficial medication; both from a preventative of re-modelling and a reduction in heart rate.\n\nHeart rate is a well established modifiable risk factor, which when appropriately controlled can improve morbidity and mortality in heart failure. This patient's heart rate is not well controlled.\n\nBisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol and metoprolol are the only evidence-based cardioselective beta blockers for heart failure patients.\n\nIvabradine is an If (funny) channel blocker, which reduces heart rate by blocking the If current in the sinoatrial node. NICE guidelines advocate the use of ivabradine for heart failure in a select group of patients:\n\n- \uf0b7 Ejection fraction &lt;35%\n- \uf0b7 Heart rate &gt;75/min\n- \uf0b7 Sinus rhythm\n- \uf0b7 NYHA class 2-4\n- \uf0b7 Maximally titrated beta blocker therapy.\n\nSince this patient is not on maximal beta blocker therapy, it would not be appropriate to commence ivabradine. Diltiazem may be used as an anti-anginal medication, but this patient does not have angina. Digoxin may be of benefit in heart rate, especially if the patient has atrial fibrillation, but should only be considered following failure of first and second line therapies."

The patient reports she experienced a subacute onset of chest discomfort that was quickly followed by symptoms of breathlessness and feeling faint. She thinks she 'blacked out' for a few seconds before recovering. Now she is feeling well with no symptoms.\n\nOn further questioning, she does not exercise regularly as she has experienced shortness of breath and chest discomfort in the past. She believes she has had a few episodes of feeling light-headed but has never fainted before. She is otherwise well with no recent illness or significant past medical history.\n\nObservations are all within normal range and an ECG performed is shown below.\n\nWhat is the patient's most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\n- a) Brugada syndrome\n- b) Dilated cardiomyopathy\n- c) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy\n- d) Wellen's syndrome\n- e) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThis patient has presented with features in keeping with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The condition is due to a genetic defect causing a disorder of the cardiac muscle and, although patients can be asymptomatic, it is the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Patients who do present with symptoms typically experience exertional dyspnoea, angina and syncope episodes, commonly during or following exertion. ECG findings, as seen in this case, are of left ventricular hypertrophy, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion and deep Q waves. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cardiac echo and management is dependent on the extent of obstruction and patient symptoms.\n\nBrugada syndrome is another genetic cardiac disorder however unlike HOCM it results in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death however it is not always associated with exertion or exercise. There are several types of Brugada syndrome with variation seen on ECG however the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved\n\nST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3, followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as Brugada sign.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial and is characterised by progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Presentation is normal with worsening biventricular failure including peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Syncope episodes are rare and symptoms are not fluctuant, as seen in this patient. ECG abnormalities are those associated with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with conduction delays (e.g. LBBB), left axis deviation and poor R wave progression.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2 and 3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic-like symptoms.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is due to a genetic defect affecting the desmosomes of the myocardium. ARVD results in a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy mainly affecting the right ventricle leading to areas of hypokinesia and myocardium replacement with fibrofat. These changes can results in associated arrhythmias. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncope, and potentially sudden cardiac death however ECG findings are of T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3 and of right bundle branch block which are not present in this case."

Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia is associated with underlying colonic malignancies in approximately 10 to 25 percent of patients, therefore, all patients presenting with this should be investigated for rectal cancer. The gold standard investigation is a colonoscopy.\n\nIf a malignancy was found on colonoscopy then a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis would be warranted to look for metastases, but it would not be as sensitive as a colonoscopy to look for colonic malignancies. An ultrasound of the abdomen would also be less sensitive to diagnose colonic malignancies than a colonoscopy.\n\nA CT-PET scan may well show a malignancy in the colon, but the patient must be exposed to radioactive dye and radiation, therefore is not the first line investigation.\n\nRepeat blood cultures would be useful when determining the length of treatment needed for this patient, however, they would not aid in the discovery of the underlying diagnosis."

The following day she has an open reduction and internal fixation of the left tibia and fibula and remains in hospital for physiotherapy. She is quite immobile during this period and then develops subsequent painful swelling and erythema of the left calf. Subsequent ultrasonography confirms a left-sided above knee deep vein thrombosis.\n\nBefore treatment starts, she develops sudden onset weakness in her right leg and right arm, dysarthric speech and a reduction in conscious level. Subsequent CT scanning confirms the presence of a left-sided infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory. Doppler investigation of the carotids shows a 20% stenosis on the left side and 10% on the right side. The 24-hour tape shows average heart rate 52bpm with 1.5s pauses maximum, sinus bradycardia\n\nWhich of the following features from further investigations would best explain this woman's presentation?\n\n- a) Anti phospholipid antibody positive\n- b) Protein C deficiency\n- c) Patent foramen ovale (PFO)\n- d) Hypercholesterolaemia\n- e) Dilated cardiomyopathy on ECHO\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nThis unfortunate lady has developed a thrombus as a result of her recent operation and subsequent immobility. Part of the thrombus has embolised into her left middle cerebral artery.\n\nOne would normally expect the source of the embolus to be from the carotids or from the heart. However, the minimal carotid stenosis and lack of history of atrial fibrillation make this less likely. The finding of a PFO on an ECHO would explain how a thrombus from the leg would reach the brain rather than the lungs.\n\nPFOs are extremely common and have been found in 25-30% of people at autopsy. PFOs have been linked to an increased risk of stroke. There is also some evidence that subclinical DVTs in the presence of a PFO may be one cause for cryptogenic stroke http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1120253\n\nThe evidence is however limited that PFO closure will reduce the risk of stroke.\n\nThe other options except E are all risk factors for stroke but cannot explain the mechanism of embolism with near-normal carotids and sinus rhythm. E is not associated with an increased risk of embolic stroke."

He has started to develop symptoms of progressive exertional shortness of breath and is concerned about having this treated. He has not had any other symptoms and on examination, there is no peripheral oedema or chest signs. A recent echocardiogram demonstrates a provoked left ventricular outflow gradient of 64mmHg. What would be the most appropriate medical therapy?\n\n- a) Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor\n- b) Beta-blocker\n- c) Nitrate\n- d) Digoxin\n\n## e) Ace-inhibitor\n\nThe correct answer is beta-blocker. Beta-blockers and verapamil can help with symptom management as they control the heart rate to the point where ventricular outflow obstruction is unlikely to occur. Nitrates and ace-inhibitors are contra-indicated as they lower blood pressure which can be very dangerous when combined with hypotension when the outflow is obstructed, whilst phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and digoxin would offer no benefit. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors have a greater role in pulmonary hypertension whilst digoxin can be used to control the heart rate in AF when the patient is sedentary or there is coexisting heart failure."

He also complains of progressive shortness of breath on exertion over the last 2 weeks. He was discharged from the cardiology ward 21 days ago after having a drug-eluting stent inserted following an anterolateral myocardial infarction. His past medical history includes diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\nOn examination, he is afebrile with a temperature of 36.4\u00baC. His heart rate is 88 beats/min and regular with a blood pressure of 139/82mmHg. On auscultation, there are bibasal crepitations with saturations of 90% on air. There is pitting oedema to his mid-shins with soft and non-tender calves.\n\nAn ECG is taken, as shown below:\n\n\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Anterior myocardial infarction\n- b) Left ventricular aneurysm\n- c) Papillary muscle rupture\n- d) Pericarditis\n- e) Pulmonary embolism\n\nThis patient has a diagnosis of a left ventricular aneurysm , a rare but serious complication of an anterior myocardial infarction. The complication tends to present more than 2 weeks after a myocardial infarction and symptoms may include chest pain or congestive heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath and fluid overload). This patient's ECG shows ST elevation in V1-V3 with QS waves and upright T waves. Persistent ST elevation after a myocardial infarction is suggestive of a left ventricular aneurysm. However, in a patient with a recent history of ischaemia, it is also important to exclude another ischaemic event. A left ventricular aneurysm is much more likely if there are absent reciprocal ST changes, dynamic ST changes and well-formed Q or QS waves.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome is an important diagnosis to consider following a myocardial infarction. However, ECG findings that are more typical of acute coronary ischaemia include new ST changes with dynamic and reciprocal changes, which are not seen here. Furthermore, the more gradual onset of symptoms is more suggestive of an alternative diagnosis such as a left ventricular aneurysm.\n\nPapillary muscle rupture is incorrect. An anterolateral myocardial infarction causes rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle, producing symptoms of mitral regurgitation. Although symptoms of congestive cardiac failure are evident in such cases, the onset of symptoms is usually more acute compared to a left ventricular aneurysm. Furthermore, it does not explain this patient's ECG changes or normal heart sounds (where a pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may be seen).\n\nPericarditis is incorrect. Unlike Dressler's syndrome, post-MI pericarditis is an acute complication within the first 48 hours. The presentation is also similar to acute pericarditis with pleuritic chest pain worse on lying flat.\n\nPulmonary embolism is incorrect. ECG findings consistent with a pulmonary embolism include sinus tachycardia, RAD, RBBB or S1Q3T3. It does not explain this patient's ST elevation."

Immigration officials had been concerned about the patient's well-being immediately on his arrival in the country. The patient reported feeling progressively more unwell over the previous 3 months after he had fled from his village in Syria. The primary symptoms reported by the patient were fevers, severe night sweats and profound fatigue. In addition, the patient had found that his exercise tolerance has greatly reduced in the previous four weeks and he became markedly breathless on minimal exertion.\n\nThe patient explained that he had experienced a prolonged period of inadequate food and shelter due to the war in his home country and while travelling across Europe.

It is likely that the patient's prolonged exposure to inadequate living conditions has weakened his immune system allowing the development of an opportunistic infection.\n\nOf the available options, Brucella melitensis is the most likely to be the causative microorganism. Endocarditis - most commonly of the aortic valve - is a rare complication of Brucella; however, it is responsible for the majority of mortality from this disease. Of the different Brucella species known to cause endocarditis Brucella melitensis is known to be associated with the most severe complications.\n\nBrucellosis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient due to his history of consumption of unpasteurised milk products and close contact with livestock from an endemic region. The clinical sign of malodorous sweat is considered to be nearly pathognomonic for Brucellosis. In addition, the patient's blood results are typical for the condition featuring lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia.\n\nThe patient requires blood cultures and serological testing to confirm the diagnosis. Given the severity of the patient's condition, he would require treatment with empirical antibiotics with consideration of aortic valve replacement at an appropriate point in the future.\n\nThe other available answers are all organisms known to be rare causes of endocarditis that usually will not be identified without specialist microbiological investigations. There is no information in the case presentation that makes any of these microorganisms a more likely causative agent of endocarditis than Brucella melitensis .\n\nRamin B, MacPherson P.

There is ST elevation in leads I, aVL, and v6. There is ST depression in lead v3 and v4. Conduction appears to be normal. There are two premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).\n\nThe above findings can be explained by an acute coronary syndrome involving the posterior and lateral coronary territories. Posterior chest leads would help to confirm a posterior myocardial infarction, so repeat ECG with posterior chest leads is the correct answer.\n\nA venous blood gas would be the option of choice if aiming to confirm diabetic ketoacidosis, but given the blood glucose is &lt;11.0 mmol/L and ketonuria is less than 2+, this diagnosis is less likely.\n\nCT scan of the abdomen would be correct if her symptoms were thought to be coming from an intraabdominal cause, but given the ECG evidence of an acute coronary syndrome which would explain her epigastric discomfort and vomiting, this seems less likely.\n\nSerum cortisol would be useful in confirming a diagnosis of adrenal crisis, which could present as epigastric discomfort, hypotension and vomiting. The ECG findings make the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome more likely.\n\nAbdominal x-ray would be useful in looking for evidence to suggest bowel obstruction or perforation. Obstruction would not explain the territorial STsegment changes and so is not correct in this instance."

As such, he should receive two weeks of single anti-platelet treatment (aspirin 300mg once daily) as with all ischaemic strokes, followed by lifelong anticoagulation with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban, to prevent further strokes secondary to atrial fibrillation. Initiation of apixaban is delayed by two weeks post-stroke to prevent haemorrhagic transformation.\n\nApixaban for life is the incorrect answer. Therapeutic anticoagulation with a DOAC should not be initiated until after two weeks to avoid hemorrhagic transformation of an ischaemic stroke.\n\nAspirin 300mg once daily for 14 days, then clopidogrel 75mg once daily for life is the incorrect answer. This would be the correct answer if this patient did not have atrial fibrillation. Clopidogrel is insufficiently anti-thrombotic to prevent strokes secondary to atrial fibrillation and therefore a lifelong DOAC is required.\n\nClopidogrel 75mg once daily for life is the incorrect answer. A higher dose of antiplatelet is required to initially treat an ischaemic stroke (aspirin 300mg) and a DOAC is required long-term to reduce the atrial fibrillation-associated stroke risk.\n\nThrombolysis with alteplase, then apixaban for life is the incorrect answer. This patient does not meet the criteria for thrombolysis as he awoke with the symptoms - thrombolysis requires symptom onset within the past four hours."

She now feels well and is ready for discharge. She has a background of type two diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis and dementia. Her medication history includes metformin 500mg BD, ramipril 2.5mg OD, levothyroxine 75 mcg OD and paracetamol 500mg QDS PRN. On the first two days in hospital, her metformin was stopped, but her other medications continued as in the community during her admission.\n\nIt is noted that she has persistently high blood pressure despite being confirmed as taking ramipril. What is the most appropriate plan to control her hypertension?\n\n- a) Increase the dose of ramipril and check U&amp;Es within 1-2 weeks\n- b) Increase the dose of ramipril and check U&amp;Es within 3-4 weeks\n- c) Add amlodipine, increase the dose of ramipril and check U&amp;Es within 3-4 weeks\n- d) Add on amlodipine at a low dose\n- e) Stop ramipril and start amlodipine instead\n\nThe correct answer is to increase the dose of ramipril and to check U&amp;Es within 12 weeks. The patient is on a low dose of ramipril and there is room to increase it, and this should be done prior to adding on a second anti-hypertensive. It is important to test renal function within two weeks of either starting or increasing the dose of an ACE inhibitor to exclude deteriorating renal function, which would need to be investigated promptly. Amlodipine would have been a more appropriate anti-hypertensive choice if she did not have diabetes."

She is normally fit and drinks the occasional small glass of red wine when she goes out for a meal. The last episode was four days ago when she was cooking in her kitchen. She describes that she felt light headed with central chest discomfort that eased after twenty minutes.

It is more common in women compared to men.\n\nAll patients with suspected atrial fibrillation should have a manual pulse check followed by a twelve-lead electrocardiogram. Those who have episodes less than 24 hours apart should have a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. In patients who experience episodes more than 24 hours apart, an event recorder electrocardiogram would be the most suitable investigation of choice.\n\n24-hour blood pressure monitoring would be considered in a patient with suspected hypertension.\n\nElectrocardiogram treadmill test is useful for revealing abnormal heart rhythms induced by exercise and ischaemic changes suggestive of coronary heart disease.\n\nA 72-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram is used in much the same way as a 24 and 48-hour test. However, current NICE guidelines suggest for atrial fibrillation of episodes more than 24 hours apart an event recorder device is most useful."

His past medical history also includes benign prostatic hypertrophy and essential thrombocytosis.\n\nHis other medications include tiotropium 18 micrograms OD, tamsulosin 400 micrograms OD, ramipril 2.5mg and simvastatin 40mg. He has recently stopped a tablet due to shortness of breath but cannot remember what it was.\n\nOn arrival, he is tachycardic with a heart rate of 215 /min. He is alert. He denies chest pain but is aware of some shortness of breath. He is attached to a 3-lead cardiac monitor which shows a narrow complex tachycardia of 210-220 beats per minute. It is difficult to tell on the monitor however it appears regular. A 12-lead\n\nECG confirms a regular narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 215/min.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Atrial fibrillation\n- b) Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction\n- c) Atrial flutter with variable conduction\n- d) Atrio-ventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT)\n- e) Atrio-ventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)\n\n## Correct answer is b.\n\nFlecainide is a pure sodium channel blocker which prolongs the cardiac action potential to slow conduction. It is recognised to increase the risk of AF transforming into flutter. Flutter with 1:1 conduction would result in a ventricular rate of 300 /min which is impossible to conduct via the AV node. However, because flecainide slows the rate of cardiac conduction it means that if a patient develops atrial flutter the atrial rate will not be 300 /min, but more likely around 200 /min which then could conduct via the AV node at a 1:1 ratio. For this reason, patients should always be co-prescribed a beta blocker to reduce risk if this happens, and you wonder if this was the tablet that had recently been stopped.\n\nThe key to this question is recognising the increased risk of atrial fibrillation transforming into atrial flutter in patients on flecainide. The regular rhythm on ECG makes atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with variable conduction less likely. He has no specific risk factors for AVRT or AVNRT, however, his flecainide use increases the chance of atrial flutter and therefore this is the correct answer."

The patient presented to the emergency department due to ongoing nausea and vomiting secondary to hyperemesis gravidarum. The patient stated she was 10 weeks pregnant with her first child and had been suffering from these symptoms for the past 6 weeks. Clinical records indicated the patient had also attended the emergency department 3 weeks previously with the same presenting complaint.\n\nOn the initial occasion the patient had presented to the emergency department with hyperemesis gravidarum, she had been rehydrated with intravenous fluids and prescribed vitamin B6 and ginger capsules four times daily on the advice of the obstetric team. The patient reported that this treatment had given her only a modest improvement in her symptoms and she had stopped taking these medications after a few days. Subsequently, she had attended an out-of-hours medical centre and been prescribed ondansetron (4 mg three times daily). The patient had found a more significant benefit from ondansetron and had been taking it regularly over the past 2 weeks. In addition to her symptoms of nausea and vomiting, the patient reported feeling tired, lethargic and dehydrated. However, she denied experiencing any other symptoms, including palpitations or pre-syncopal episodes.\n\nThe patient's past medical history included a period of intravenous drug use in her early twenties. Three years previously the patient had successfully managed to stop her use of illicit drugs after being enrolled in a methadone treatment program. The patient was now on a consistent methadone dose of 80 mg once daily. There was no other significant past medical history and the patient took no other regular medications.\n\nDuring the patient's assessment after attending the emergency department, concern was raised over a prolonged corrected QT interval on an ECG performed due to borderline hypokalaemia. The patient's ECG was otherwise unremarkable and was compared to previous ECGs the patient had undergone on her previous visits to the emergency department. Please see below for blood results and data from the patient's current and previous ECG.\n\nHaemoglobin\n\n123 g / dL\n\nMean cell volume\n\n84.9 fl\n\nWhite cell count\n\n11.7 x 10&gt;3 / microlitre\n\nPlatelets\n\n187 x 10&gt;3 / microlitre\n\nUrea\n\n9.0 mmol / L\n\nCreatinine\n\n82 micromol / L\n\nSodium\n\n139 mmol / L\n\nPotassium\n\n3.6 mmol / L\n\n| Presentation                      | Relative date of ECG   |   Corrected QT interval / ms |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2nd ED attendance for hyperemesis | Today                  |                          490 |\n| 1st ED attendance for hyperemesis | 3 weeks previously     |                          430 |\n| Unrelated ED attendance           | 4 years previously     |                          415 |\n\nWith regard to the patient's prolonged corrected QT interval, what is the most appropriate strategy for managing her medications?\n\n- a) Continue both methadone and ondansetron and admit for cardiac monitoring\n- b) Stop both methadone and ondansetron\n- c) Continue both methadone and ondansetron and arrange outpatient ambulatory ECG\n- d) Continue methadone, stop ondansetron\n- e) Continue ondansetron, stop methadone\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nThe upper limit of normal for corrected QT interval is considered to be 450 ms in men and 460 ms in women. QT prolongation is associated with torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. However, the presence of a prolonged QT interval does not inevitably lead to TdP and TdP can occur in the presence of a normal QT interval. Each 10 ms increase in QT interval increases the risk of TdP by around 5-7 % and once corrected QT interval exceeds 500 ms, the risk of TdP is markedly increased and intervention is necessary.\n\nThe patient is taking 2 medications that are known to prolong the QT interval and these can be seen to have had an additive effect in prolonging the patient's QT interval. Specifically, the corrected QT interval increased from 430 ms when the patient was taking methadone to 490 ms when the patient was taking methadone and ondansetron. The normal baseline ECG suggests that the patient does not have a congenital condition causing QT prolongation. At the time of presentation, the patient's borderline hypokalaemia is a factor increasing the risk of TdP in the setting of her drug-induced prolonged QT interval.\n\nFew recommendations exist for managing the risk of drug-induced prolonged QT interval. Expert advice suggests that when a QT prolonging drug is associated with a corrected QT interval of 480-500 ms in a woman (470-500 ms in a man), or when an increase of 60 ms or greater occurs, dose reduction or discontinuation is advised. If the corrected QT interval exceeds 500 ms then the drug should be discontinued and expert advice sought.\n\nThe use of methadone alone does not appear to cause a prolonged QT interval in this patient, whereas her QT interval increased by 60 ms following the addition of ondansetron. Given the importance to the patient's long-term health of adequate opiate replacement therapy, the risks associated with opiate withdrawal to a foetus in early pregnancy and the availability of other anti-emetic medications the most sensible course of action out of the available options is to discontinue ondansetron and continue methadone treatment.\n\nAdvice from the cardiology team could be sought to determine if the patient should be admitted for cardiac monitoring. The only available answer to include admission as an option also requires the patient to continue with both medications that prolong the QT interval and so is incorrect. Continuing both medications and discharging the patient for an outpatient ambulatory ECG (presumably to assess for TdP) is not an advisable management plan.\n\nQT interval and drug therapy.

The combination of a lacey rash (livedo reticularis) and raised eosinophils points to a likely diagnosis of cholesterol embolism. Contrast induced nephropathy is also possible following angiography but is not associated with rash or eosinophilia. Although renal function may deteriorate after starting an ACE inhibitor, it is unlikely to cause this degree of derangement so quickly. As the angiogram was uncomplicated, hypovolaemia is unlikely. Endocarditis would be unusual in the absence of fevers and other systemic signs."

A recent 24-hour tape arranged because of episodes of pre-syncope demonstrates sustained atrial fibrillation with episodes of bradycardia (minimum heart rate 20 beats per minute) associated with symptoms of pre-syncope.\n\nThe admission ECG demonstrates slow atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 24 beats per minute.\n\nThe patient has recovered by the time he has been assessed by the medical team and his Glasgow coma scale is 15/15 and his heart rate is 82 beats per minute.\n\nA decision is made to insert a permanent pacemaker.\n\nWhat is the appropriate mode to programme the pacing system?\n\n- a) AAI\n- b) AOO\n- c) OOO\n- d) VAT\n- e) VVI\n\nVVI or VVR pacemakers are useful for pure sustained AF. Since the atria are not functioning they do not require sensing or pacing\n\nVVI is the correct pacing mode. In this mode, the ventricle is sensed and the ventricle is paced. If a QRS complex is detected, it doesn't fire. If it is not detected i.e. there has been no ventricular electrical activity within the interval specified by its set rate, then it will fire. This is suitable for atrial fibrillation as the atria are not working correctly and there will be no detectable P wave and therefore the atria do not need to be sensed or paced.\n\nAAI is not the correct pacing mode to choose. AAI pacing mode means atrial paced, atrial sensed, and inhibition of pacing output in response to an atrial sensed event (P wave). Since the atria are not functioning in AF, they do not require sensing or pacing. AAI pacing has better hemodynamic features than dualchamber pacing and is the best mode for patients with sick sinus syndrome without a significant AV conduction disorder. This mode essentially relies on the AV node to fire and guarantees a certain atrial rate.\n\nAOO is incorrect. This is asynchronous pacing. This refers to the continuous pacing of the atria irrespective of the presence or absence of an intrinsic rhythm. This pacing mode is limited to rare cases, such as when pacemaker-dependent patients (who do not have a ventricular paced setting) are subject to artefact (e.g., electrocautery during surgery), which could result in asystole due to oversensing and pacing inhibition if the pacemaker has been set to a non-asynchronous mode. It is never a permanent mode.\n\nOOO is incorrect. This essentially means there is no sensing, no pacing and no response to sensing. It means the pacemaker is turned off.\n\nVAT is incorrect. This mode means the atria are sensed and the ventricles are paced. This is suitable for a patient with a dysfunctional AV node but working atria. For example, in someone with a complete heart block and a normal atrial rate, a VAT pacemaker will sense the atrium and pace the ventricle in response."

A friend attends with him and states that some of the lads had taken MCAT (Mephedrone) but he is unsure whether Michael also took MCAT. Michael felt well when he woke up but realised that he was late for his football match so rushed out of the house without any breakfast. He had just scored the first goal of the match when he collapsed. When he came around he complained of palpitations.\n\nHis past medical history includes asthma and hay fever for which he takes regular antihistamines. During the ambulance ride to hospital the paramedic performed some observations and an ECG. He was found to have a blood glucose of 3.6 and was given some GlucoGel and a biscuit. Other observations included a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 135/min which was irregular, irregular in character, respiratory rate of 16/min, afebrile.\n\nThe emergency department doctor reviewed the ECG and diagnosed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response and prescribed digoxin in view of his asthma history and blood pressure readings. The patient had a normal QTc. Five minutes later the cardiac monitor showed a broad complex tachycardia and Michael became unresponsive.\n\nWhat was the cause of the patient's collapse?\n\n- a) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- b) MCAT related arrhythmia\n- c) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n- d) Alcohol induced atrial fibrillation\n- e) Torsades de pointes\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a disorder of the conduction system also known as a pre-excitation syndrome. The incidence of WPW is between 0.1% and 0.3% in the general population. Sudden cardiac death in people with WPW is rare (incidence of less than 0.6%).\n\nIn WPW there is an abnormal accessory pathway called the 'Bundle of Kent' found between the atria and ventricles. If this pathway is used signals may stimulate the ventricles to contract prematurely, resulting in atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.\n\nNormally the AV node acts as a gatekeeper limiting the amount of electrical activity that can reach the ventricles. If a patient has an arrhythmia whereby the atria generate an excessively fast rhythm such as atrial flutter or fibrillation the AV node is able to reduce the amount of electrical activity that reaches the ventricles. However, the Bundle of Kent does not possess the ability to limit the electrical signals to the ventricles. If the person has an atrial arrhythmia the signals can pass down the bundle and cause the ventricles to contract at the same rate. In the extreme heart rates and when the accessory pathway is used the patient may develop dangerous cardiac arrhythmias which can trigger ventricular fibrillation and lead to death.\n\nIn WPW certain medications that can block the AV node or those that can enhance conduction down the accessory pathway by increasing the refractory period in the AV node should be avoided. These include digoxin, adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil, other calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. In this case, the patient's WPW was worsened by administration of digoxin and her arrhythmia developed into ventricular fibrillation.\n\nPeople with WPW are usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may complain of shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness and syncope. Diagnosis is usually made by ECG as patients may have the characteristic 'delta wave'. Patients may also be found to be in atrial fibrillation or have SVT Treatment can include cardioversion in emergencies otherwise amiodarone. Definitive treatment would be ablation."

Complete heart block is a recognised complication of both inferior and anterior STEMI. Inferior STEMI CHB is usually more transient and they only require treatment if they become symptomatic. Anterior STEMI CHB is a more serious complication and they are more likely to need a permanent pacing system. In this case, as he has not responded to atropine then isoprenaline infusion is unlikely to work. There is no suggestion of repeat infarction so angiography is not indicated.

Although the ECG is neither sensitive nor specific for pulmonary embolism, the classical findings of S1Q3T3 highly suggest right ventricular strain. Hence, the clinical picture is highly suspicious for pulmonary embolism, and the patient should promptly have an urgent CT pulmonary angiogram and thrombolysis if indicated. Other acute causes for right ventricular strain, like pneumothorax, upper airway obstruction and exacerbation of asthma/COPD, should also be considered in the differentials.\n\nNon ST elevation myocardial infarction is incorrect. ECG changes like ST depression or T wave inversion in NSTEMI are often non-specific. If new, the Twave inversions in this patient may suggest acute coronary syndrome, particularly right ventricular infarction, given the right ventricular strain pattern; however, NSTEMI is unlikely to cause collapse. The classical S1Q3T3 pattern in ECG, along with the clinical findings of tachycardia, tachypnoea and low-grade temperature, is more suggestive of pulmonary embolism in this patient.\n\nST elevation myocardial infarction is incorrect. Classically, STEMI is diagnosed if there is &gt; 1-2 mm ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads or a new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Both of these are not found in this patient's ECG.\n\nSevere hypokalaemia is incorrect. Although hypokalaemia may present with Twave inversions in the precordial leads, there are no ST depression or U waves commonly seen in hypokalaemia. While hypokalaemia can cause muscle tetany, paralysis and respiratory failure, it is unlikely to cause collapse.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is incorrect. ECG changes like T wave inversion in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are often non-specific.

This patient has a likely diagnosis of stable angina, as he suffers from exertional chest pain which is alleviated by the use of GTN spray. As he is currently taking a beta-blocker at the maximum permissible dose, the next most appropriate step in management is to add in a calcium channel blocker. In this scenario, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred to non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, due to the increased risk of the latter causing complete heart block in combination with beta-blockers.\n\nRefer for assessment for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG is incorrect. As the patient has stable angina, with no symptoms at rest, he does not warrant urgent referral for PCI. Non-urgent referral for PCI or CABG would be appropriate if his symptoms were not improved by the addition of amlodipine.\n\nStart isosorbide mononitrate is incorrect.

Atrial fibrillation with aberrant conduction\n2. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)\n3. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)\n4. Supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction\n5. Ventricular flutter\n\nThe ECG demonstrates a broad-complex tachycardia. It can be difficult to distinguish between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction (e.g. LBBB). Therefore it is always safest to assume that the arrhythmia is ventricular in origin until proven otherwise.\n\nElectrocardiographic features that increase the likelihood of VT include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Absence of typical RBBB or LBBB morphology\n- \uf0b7 Extreme axis deviation ('northwest axis'): QRS positive in aVR and negative in I and aVF\n- \uf0b7 Very broad complexes &gt; 160ms\n- \uf0b7 AV dissociation\n- \uf0b7 Capture beats\n- \uf0b7 Fusion beats\n- \uf0b7 Positive concordance throughout the precordial leads\n- \uf0b7 Negative concordance throughout the precordial leads\n- \uf0b7 RSR' complexes with an R&gt;R'\n\nMonomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the correct option. The ECG demonstrates RSR' complexes with an R&gt;R' which is the most specific finding in favour of VT. Since the morphology of the QRS waves is similar beat to beat then the diagnosis is monomorphic VT rather than polymorphic VT.\n\nAtrial fibrillation with aberrant conduction is incorrect. The presence of P waves (seen best in lead II) and the regular rhythm make this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nPolymorphic ventricular tachycardia is incorrect. This would also present with a broad complex tachycardia with similar criteria as discussed above. However, in this condition, the morphology of the ventricular complex would vary from beat to beat.\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction is incorrect. Although this is a possibility, the extremely broad QRS duration and the presence of RSR' complexes with R&gt;R' favour the diagnosis of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\nVentricular flutter is incorrect. This condition is an extreme form of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with loss of organised electrical activity.

She sometimes used a nitrate spray to relieve episodes of angina but found that it normally made her very dizzy.\n\nClinical examination was unremarkable except for a blood pressure of 98 / 65 mmHg.\n\nPlease see below for results of recent investigations.\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram: normal valvular function; moderately impaired left ventricular; ejection fraction 35 %.\n\nElectrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute; normal axis; normal QRS complex, normal ST segments and T waves.\n\nUrea\n\n15.6 mmol / L\n\nCreatinine\n\n234 micromol / L\n\nSodium\n\n135 mmol / L\n\nPotassium\n\n4.9 mmol / L\n\nCardiac stress MRI: evidence of mild myocardial ischaemia in left anterior descending territory, estimated &lt; 10 % myocardium ischaemic.\n\nWhat is the correct next line therapy for the patients angina?\n\n1. Percutaneous coronary intervention\n2. Nicorandil\n3. Ranolazine\n4. Ivabradine\n5. Long-acting isosorbide mononitrate\n\nThe patient has stable angina and has been intolerant of first line medical therapy. Due to her co-morbidities several of the second-line medical therapy options are contra-indicated. Ranolazine acts a late inward calcium channel antagonist but is contra-indicated in severe renal disease. Both nicorandil and ISMN are contraindicated in this patient due to her history of hypotension.\n\nTherefore, ivabradine is the most appropriate option. The drug acts as an If channel antagonist to reduce heart rate and is appropriate in this patient without a history of bradycardia. It should not be used in patients with moderate to severe angina as it has been shown to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events in these patients.\n\nRevascularisation techniques such as PCI have not been show to reduce mortality or rate of MI in stable coronary artery disease. Therefore, medical therapy options should be exhausted before consideration of invasive treatment (particularly in this patient with renal failure making contrast administration very undesirable).\n\nAl-Lamee R, Davies J, Malik I.

The emergency department doctor has administered a 300mg bolus of amiodarone and the consultant subsequently inserted a central venous line to continue amiodarone treatment with a 900mg infusion over 24 hours. He transiently settles but on the second day of admission, his cardiac monitor demonstrates persistent VT at 180 beats per minute again. His blood pressure is 140/75 mmHg. What is your treatment?\n\n1. No treatment\n2. Repeat bolus of amiodarone 300mg\n3. DC cardioversion\n4. Intravenous lidocaine infusion\n5. Emergency VT ablation\n\nThe patient has entered refractory VT, continuing despite a therapeutic dose of amiodarone and sufficient loading. It is unlikely further boluses of amiodarone will produce additional therapeutic effects. Similarly, no treatment is not an option, his myocardium is unlikely to continue tolerating such a persistent tachycardia without soon reducing left ventricular output and arrest. He is not haemodynamically unstable and hence does not justify DC cardioversion as an emergency procedure. Similarly, emergency VT ablation is not appropriate after only 1st line treatment. Intravenous lidocaine is the second line treatment: first as a bolus, followed by an infusion regime over 6.5 hours."

    "block": "## Question #139\n\nAn 87-year-old gentleman is reviewed in the cardiology clinic. He has unstable angina with multiple confluent lesions in all three main coronary vessels and in major tributaries on angiography. The lesions are not amenable to stenting or bypass. On assessment in the clinic, the blood pressure is 104/43mmHg, heart rate is 57bpm. His ECG confirms atrial fibrillation but no new ischaemic changes. There is no clinical sign of heart failure. He is currently taking aspirin, bisoprolol, ramipril, isosorbide mononitrate, nicorandil and simvastatin. His main symptom is chest pain on minimal exertion.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate drug to control this patients angina?\n\n- a) Diltiazem\n- b) Digoxin\n- c) Ivabradine\n- d) Omega\n- e) Ranolazine\n\nNational guidelines were published by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) on the management of stable angina in 2007 with updates by NICE in 2011. Stable angina is defined as chest pain of cardiac aetiology which is precipitated by exertion with a demonstrable flow limiting lesion on angiography. Many patients who experience angina will ultimately go on to have revascularisation procedures to improve or restore coronary flow which will improve their symptoms of angina, however while waiting for interventional procedures optimisation of drug therapy is the aim. Drug therapy also is considered first-line treatment for non-critical lesions.\n\nFirst line therapy in the treatment of angina is beta-blockade. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by acting as a negative inotrope and also by reducing heart rate. Some patients are unable to take beta-blockers such as asthmatics, or find that side effects such as tiredness, eczema or sexual dysfunction mean they are not tolerable. In these instances, use of calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem are recommended as first-line treatment. Since both of these classes of drug cause a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure their use must be monitored carefully, especially in the elderly. Concomitant use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers should be avoided where possible due to the risk of high degree conduction block and cardiac arrest.\n\nLong-acting nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate are considered second-line therapy in stable angina. They can be used as monotherapy or as an adjunct to beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy. They work by causing vasodilatation; both drugs possess a nitric oxide moiety which causes endothelial relaxation in blood vessels. This causes coronary vasodilation and improved blood flow to the myocardium with improved symptoms. A consequence of vasodilatation is hypotension and this should be considered when prescribing this drug to patients.\n\nAnother second-line option drug for stable angina in those patients who cannot tolerate nitrates or they are ineffective is nicorandil. This drug has a similar ultimate effect in that it causes dilatation of peripheral and coronary vessels to reduce symptoms of angina. It works by activating potassium channels on endovascular smooth muscle cells reducing intracellular calcium and hence relaxing the blood vessel. It too can cause profound hypotension and severe headaches.\n\nIvabradine is a drug which can be used for both angina and heart failure. It works by reducing heart rate to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve diastolic function. In this case, the heart rate is adequately controlled so reduction is not necessary. Ivabradine also works by inhibiting the hearts natural pacemaker potential in the sinoatrial node, hence it only works when the patient is in sinus rhythm, unlike here.\n\nRanolazine is a viable option in the management of angina where other avenues have been exhausted. It works by inhibiting the delayed sodium influx channel in the myocardium, reducing the intracellular calcium concentrations in the heart muscle. This, in turn, leads to a negative inotropic effect and reduction in symptoms of angina. Ranolazine does not cause a profound hypotensive effect and is the best choice in this scenario.\n\nDigoxin is not commented upon as a specific treatment for heart failure in NICE guidance although it does have a modest positive inotropic effect. The relative bradycardia of the patient in the vignette makes this an unwise choice here.\n\nOmega 3 and other fatty fish oils are not recommended to be prescribed to heart failure patients in NICE guidance due to lack of evidence of any effectiveness."

There is no evidence of pedal oedema.\n\nGiven the likely diagnosis, what might you see on the ECG?\n\n- a) Deep lateral Q waves with left ventricular hypertrophy\n- b) Electrical alternans\n- c) Global ST elevation\n- d) S1 Q3 T31\n- e) Trifascicular block\n\nElectrical alternans is suggestive of cardiac tamponade\n\nA history of dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and palpitations, associated with hypotension and tachycardia are classical symptoms of many cardiorespiratory illnesses. However, quiet or absent heart sounds with a raised JVP should raise concerns for cardiac tamponade. This can be confirmed with the ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, low QRS voltage, or electrical alternans.\n\nElectrical alternans is a diagnostic feature of large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. The alternate QRS amplitudes are due to the 'swinging' effect of the heart whilst contracting which subsequently gives rise to increased and decreased electrical impedance.\n\nDeep lateral Q waves with left ventricular hypertrophy is a classical ECG finding of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is the most common cause of sudden death in young people and is due to left ventricular hypertrophy without an identifiable cause. Patients can display all of the above symptoms. Dyspnoea is common due to left ventricular stiffness, resistance, and impaired filling. Patients may have a jerky pulse and may also present in arrhythmia, most commonly, atrial fibrillation. However, compared to the above scenario, patients have audible heart sounds, and may have a loud S1 and sometimes a 4th heart sound. There may be an ejection systolic murmur radiating to the apex which changes in intensity with a change in posture.\n\nPericarditis is associated with global ST elevation . Patients typically present with many of the above symptoms. Pericarditis is a common cause of pericardial effusion due to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac due to inflammation. The distinguishing feature between pericarditis and pericardial effusion is the presence or absence of heart sounds, with pericarditis having audible heart sounds.\n\nSymptoms of dyspnoea, palpitations, and orthopnoea, along with hypotension and tachycardia are common signs and symptoms associated with a pulmonary embolism (PE). The most common ECG finding in PE is sinus tachycardia, however, patients may have evidence of right axis deviation, atrial arrhythmia, right bundle branch block, P pulmonale, and S1 Q3 T3 . S1 Q3 T3 is the presence of deep S waves in lead I along with Q waves and T wave inversion in lead 3.\n\nTrifascicular block is the combination of third-degree atrioventricular block, right bundle branch block, and either left anterior fascicular block or left posterior fascicular block. These patients generally required pacemaker insertion. The most common causes are structural heart disease, particular fibrosis of the myocardium, and ischaemic heart disease. It may also occur in anterior myocardial infarction and aortic stenosis. Many of the pathological causes of trifascicular block may cause the symptoms described in the above scenario, however, heart sounds would still be audible. Trifascicular block is not associated with pericardial effusion."

An acute infective endocarditis is unlikely for someone who is systemically well, a regurgitant murmur would also be more likely. The symptoms cannot be attributed to delayed puberty, defined as onset of puberty outside 95% of the normal population and typically before 18 years old. The combination of primary amenorrhoea, short stature, lymphoedema, shortened 4th metacarpal, autoimmune predisposition and an ejection systolic murmur suggestive of aortic coarctation should infer a diagnosis of Turner's syndrome, a disorder caused by loss of an X chromosome.\n\nNoonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder, is a reasonable differential in a patient with short stature, lymphoedema and cardiac problems. However, patients with Noonan syndrome typically presents with learning difficulties, facial dysmorphisms and webbed neck. While valvular abnormalities are less common, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is more commonly present.\n\nSimilar to Noonan syndrome, Down's syndrome, caused by trisomy 21, also classically presents with facial dysmorphisms such as upslanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears and epicanthic folds. Cognitive impairment and learning difficulties are also common. However, similar to our patient, short stature, thyroid dysfunction and cardiac problems, predominantly ASD, VSD and PDA are frequently associated.\n\nPseudohypoparathyroidism is caused by normal parathyroid hormone release but end organ resistance to hormonal effects, resulting classically in round facies and shortened fourth and fifth metacarpals. The patient is commonly obese with possible learning difficulties.\n\nPseudopseudohypoparathyroidism presents with the phenotype of pseudohypoparathyroidism but with normal calcium chemistry."

The clinical syndrome, in this case, suggests Kawasaki disease as the cause of fever, rather than infection. This is an inflammatory rather than infective condition and does not require antibiotic treatment.\n\nCyclophosphamide is incorrect.

She has no past medical history other than eczema and this is her first pregnancy.\n\nOn examination, auscultation of her chest reveals only a mild wheeze with oxygen saturations of 94% on room air and a respiratory rate of 25/min. Her heart sounds are normal, with a heart rate of 97bpm and blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg. An ECG shows sinus rhythm.\n\nThe FY1 doctor on the ward has requested a D-dimer to try and 'speed up the diagnosis', which comes back positive.\n\nWhat is the next appropriate investigation?\n\n- a) Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) scan\n- b) Chest x-ray\n- c) Peak flow measurement\n- d) CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)\n- e) Ultrasound doppler of the lower legs\n\nIt is likely that this woman has had a pulmonary embolism given the acute nature of the shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, together with tachycardia and reduced oxygen saturations.\n\nThe correct way to investigate a pregnant woman with a possible pulmonary embolism is to first perform a chest x-ray. This is vital to ensure other diagnoses such as pneumonia and pneumothorax are identified\n\nUltrasound doppler of the lower legs is the next step as this can demonstrate a venous thromboembolism of the lower limb vasculature without radiation. If a thrombus is found, appropriate management with low molecular weight heparin can be initiated.\n\nIf the chest x-ray and the ultrasound doppler are normal, a ventilation-perfusion scan should be performed. The presence of a normal chest x-ray can essentially function as the ventilation part of the V/Q scan. This allows for a half-dose radiation V/Q scan.\n\nThe radiation dose to the foetus of a V/Q scan is slightly higher than that of a CTPA, however both are well below the threshold of specific harm to the foetus. Please note that a CTPA should only be used in the presence of lung disease including asthma or an abnormal chest x-ray, as the radiation dose to the proliferating maternal breasts may be significant in the development of carcinogenesis later in life.\n\nA d-dimer is not appropriate as it may be raised in pregnancy and may lead to further inappropriate tests based on the positive result alone."

She has been diagnosed with diabetes, heart failure and depression and is on metformin, dapagliflozin, losartan, digoxin and sertraline. She reports experiencing abdominal cramps and loose stools over the last two days, which began following dinner at a restaurant. Her heart rate is 103 beats per minute, her BP is 100/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 20 breaths/min. An ECG was taken:\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of the findings on the ECG?\n\n\n\n- a) Anxiety\n- b) Dapagliflozin\n- c) Digoxin\n- d) Metformin\n- e) Sertraline\n\nThe correct answer is digoxin . The electrocardiogram (ECG) presented demonstrates premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), which are characterised by abnormally large QRS complexes that disrupt the underlying sinus rhythm. A typical PVC is identifiable on an ECG as a broad QRS complex, exceeding 120 milliseconds in duration, with an abnormal morphology. It presents prematurely and is associated with discordant ST segment and T wave changes, followed by a compensatory pause prior to the next normal sinus impulse. Digoxin toxicity is recognised for inducing a spectrum of arrhythmias that may be life-threatening. Arrhythmias associated with digoxin toxicity include paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular (AV) blocks, junctional rhythms, and ventricular arrhythmias such as PVCs and ventricular tachycardia. Notably, PVCs are often the initial indicator of digoxin toxicity and represent the most frequent arrhythmia linked to elevated serum digoxin levels. In this case, it is probable that hypokalaemia induced by diarrhoea has precipitated the digoxin toxicity.\n\nAnxiety can lead to the emergence of PVCs; however, it is not deemed the primary cause in this clinical scenario. Anxiety-related PVCs are thought to originate from sympathetic nervous system overactivity. Nonetheless, given the circumstances described above, digoxin toxicity remains a more plausible explanation for this patient's presentation.\n\nMetformin is not associated with arrhythmias when used within therapeutic dosages. Metformin toxicity might arise in contexts such as renal impairment or intentional overdose and could result in severe lactic acidosis that may precipitate arrhythmias. Despite this possibility, hypokalaemia secondary to diarrhoea resulting in digoxin toxicity appears to be a more convincing cause for the observed PVCs.\n\nSertraline , an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is utilised primarily in managing depression and does not align with this clinical picture as a causative agent for arrhythmia. Although sertraline is among the preferred antidepressants following myocardial infarction (MI), there exists no direct association between sertraline use and arrhythmic events. It should be noted that certain psychiatric medications such as clozapine, chlorpromazine and thioridazine have been implicated in arrhythmic side effects.\n\nDapagliflozin stands incorrect for this question. As an SGLT-2 inhibitor prescribed for heart failure and diabetes management, dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce incidents of significant ventricular arrhythmias including cardiac arrest or sudden death; thus it would be improbable for dapagliflozin to account for the clinical findings described here."

This is a pacemaker that usually paces just the right atrium. This type of pacemaker has largely fallen out of favour as they require intact atrioventricular conduction and do not safeguard against this failure in the future. Typically, this type of pacing would only be used for severe symptomatic sinus bradycardia or sick sinus syndrome.

He has a soft and non-tender abdomen.\n\nAn ECG is recorded, as shown below:\n\n\n\nGiven the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\n\n- a) Discharge with NSAIDs\n- b) Fibrinolysis\n- c) Insulin and dextrose infusion\n- d) Percutaneous coronary intervention\n- e) Rivaroxaban\n\nThis patient's ECG shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) with broadened QRS complexes (&gt; 120ms), a dominant S wave in V1 (creating 'W' impression) and broad monophasic R waves in leads I, aVL, V5 and V6 (creating 'M' impression). In patients with an ECG showing LBBB, it is important to establish whether or not this is a new finding as a new presentation of LBBB is concerning for myocardial ischaemia. In combination with a history of chest pain, shortness of breath, and being clammy to touch, it is likely that this patient is having a myocardial infarction. For patients presenting to the hospital within 12 hours of a STEMI with the availability of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 2 hours, PCI is the most appropriate and definitive management of this patient where the obstructed artery can be stented. As this patient has presented within 4 hours to a tertiary centre, it is likely that PCI can be achieved and is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nIt would be inappropriate to discharge this patient with analgesia as a new finding of LBBB and a clinical history of chest pain is highly suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and needs urgent treatment.\n\nFibrinolysis is an alternative option for managing acute coronary syndrome. However, if PCI is available, it should be prioritised as the most appropriate treatment.\n\nInsulin and dextrose are used in the management of hyperkalaemia. ECG changes in hyperkalaemia commonly include peaked T waves. However, in severe hyperkalaemia, ECG changes can include bundle branch blocks including LBBB. This is much rarer than myocardial ischaemia and given the history of chest pain, shortness of breath and sweating, an acute coronary syndrome is the more likely cause for which PCI is indicated.\n\nRivaroxaban is used in the treatment of a pulmonary embolism (PE). Although this patient has a higher risk of venous thromboembolism with a previous DVT, it is very unlikely for a PE to cause LBBB."

Her past medical history includes hypertension, previous myocardial infarctions 7 months ago, chronic kidney disease and COPD. She has a 50 pack year smoking history giving up 2 years ago. Her exercise tolerance is 150 yards, limited by shortness of breath.\n\nOn examination, an ejection systolic murmur can be heard in the aortic area with bibasal crackles on chest auscultation. An admission chest x-ray is consistent with pulmonary oedema and intravenous diuresis is commenced. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrates ejection fraction of 33% with impaired left ventricular function, no vegetations, a bicuspid heavily calcified aortic valve with an area of 0.7cm2 and a peak gradient of 32mmHg. Angiography demonstrates non-flow limiting stenosis of 65% in the left anterior descending artery but no lesions requiring revascularisation. Lung function testing following successful diuresis reveals forced vital capacity at 55% of predicted and forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 48% of predicted.\n\nThe patient is keen for a definitive intervention if appropriate. What is the appropriate next action?\n\n- a) No action\n- b) Balloon aortic valvuloplasty\n- c) Aortic valve replacement\n- d) Transcatheter aortic valve implantation\n- e) Coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement\n\nThe patient has presented with pulmonary oedema on a background of severe aortic stenosis, secondary to calcifications and a bicuspid valve. Interestingly, this is a patient who presents with low-gradient low-area aortic stenosis not uncommonly encountered in more elderly patients. In the context of poor LV function, the aortic valve gradient may be normal or only mildly raised in the presence of a severely narrowed aortic valve area.\n\nA second consideration is the suitability of this patient for surgery. She has underlying lung disease secondary to COPD and functional impairment on pulmonary testing, renal impairment and recent myocardial infarction. She is a high-risk surgical candidate and unlikely suitable for aortic valve replacement. Inaction is not an option, the patient has presented with pulmonary oedema and underlying exercise-induced dyspnoea. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty is a palliative procedure prone to restenosis for patients unsuitable for other interventions. She does not require a CABG for her coronary artery disease, which worryingly seems inconsistent with the degree of left ventricular impairment, suggesting aortic stenosis to likely be responsible for the majority of symptoms. A transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) is the appropriate management in this situation. The catheter-delivered device produces similar one-year survival as aortic valve replacement but a higher risk of stroke, TIAs and vascular complications. Compared to medical management alone, one-year survival is reduced with TAVI from 50.7% to 30.7% 1 .\n\n1. Thomas M, Schymik G, Walther T et al.

She lived alone after having recently split up with her husband which had been a difficult few weeks. Her friend had been staying with her occasionally during this difficult period.\n\nShe had a family history of ischaemic heart disease. She had recently complained to her friend of a cold that was now passing. Medications included aspirin 75mg OD and bisoprolol 5mg OD. Her friend called 999 and she was admitted directly to the angiogram suite as the paramedics noticed that her ECG showed ST elevation in the anterior chest leads.\n\nHer angiogram showed mild coronary atherosclerosis but an akinetic left ventricle. Her troponin T was significantly elevated at 7800ng/L (normal &lt; 14).\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- a) Pericarditis\n- b) Myocardial infarction\n- c) Embolic event\n- d) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n- e) Pneumothorax\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, acute stress cardiomyopathy) is non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy where there is a temporary weakening of the heart muscle. This is often triggered by emotional stress or physical stress. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in post-menopausal women Patients most commonly present with chest pain and shortness of breath. Sudden onset congestive cardiac failure may also occur.\n\nOn initial presentation diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult and patients are often treated as an acute myocardial infarction. ECGs classically mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients often proceed acutely to an angiogram which shows the absence of significant heart disease. Cardiac enzymes are significantly raised.\n\nAn echocardiogram may demonstrate pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities, in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic. This coupled with the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities allows the diagnosis to be made.\n\nTreatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive. Patients may be hypotensive, however, treatment with inotropes often worsens the disease. Patients may require intra-aortic balloon pump, fluids, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Aspirin is also commonly used in the management. Once over the initial event outcomes are favourable. Even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation, it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months\n\nA 41-year-old woman attends the emergency department with a 6-hour history of palpitations and breathlessness. She denies chest pain or recent illness. Her past medical history includes type 1 diabetes and she smokes 15 cigarettes/day.\n\nOn examination, she has a heart rate of 140bpm with a blood pressure of 122/77mmHg. Peripheral pulses are present bilaterally with a capillary refill of &lt; 2 seconds. On auscultation, her heart sounds are normal with vesicular breath sounds throughout.\n\nAn ECG is taken, as shown below:\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\n- a) Atrial flutter\n- b) Sinus tachycardia\n- c) Supraventricular tachycardia\n- d) Ventricular tachycardia\n- e) Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome\n\nThis patient's ECG shows a regular, narrow-complex tachycardia in keeping with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Given the absence of clear P waves, it is likely that the cause of this SVT is an atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) secondary to a re-entry circuit causing premature ventricular contraction. SVT is more common in women with a heart rate varying from between 140-280bpm. Symptoms include palpitations and breathlessness, as seen here, and may occur spontaneously or following provocation with caffeine, drugs or alcohol.\n\nAtrial flutter is a form of supraventricular tachycardia caused by a re-entry circuit into the right atrium. This typically causes an atrial rate of 300bpm. The ventricular rate is determined by the degree of the atrioventricular block at the atrioventricular node e.g. a 2:1 block would result in a heart rate of 150bpm, whilst a 3:1 block would give a rate of 100bpm. Symptoms include palpitations or shortness of breath, whilst common ECG findings include a narrow complex tachycardia with inverted flutter waves in leads II, III and aVF, giving rise to a sawtooth appearance on the baseline of the ECG. These are not seen here, making it a less likely diagnosis.\n\nSinus tachycardia is a common ECG finding in patients presenting with palpitations. However, the absence of discernable P waves makes sinus tachycardia less likely.\n\nVentricular tachycardia presents as a broad-complex tachycardia with widened QRS complexes. This ECG shows a narrow-complex tachycardia, making ventricular tachycardia unlikely.\n\nWolff-Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome causes a tachyarrhythmia secondary to an accessory excitatory pathway stimulating premature ventricular contraction. WPW syndrome may present as palpitations, as seen in this patient. However, the ECG findings in Wolff-Parkinson White include a shortened PR interval and a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave) causing QRS interval prolongation which is not seen here."

Over the past year the patient has had a persistently raised blood pressure between 170/100mmHg and 180/110mmHg. Despite starting the patient on ramipril 5mg once daily four weeks ago the patient's blood pressure on this visit remained raised at 164/93mmHg.\n\nDuring the history taking part of the consultation the patient mentions that he has been troubled with headaches for the past year, and has noticed that his stool frequency has increased and his stools have become looser. He tells you that he's rather embarrassed to admit that he's been having flushing episodes, and feels that his clothes are much looser than they were 1 year ago.\n\nOn discussing his family history he mentions that both his mother and his father had to have cancerous lumps removed in their middle ages. His mother had a breast lump removed, and his father had some form of pancreatic mass removed.\n\nOn examination the patient is tall with a wide arm span. Examination of the cardiovascular system reveals only a minor tachycardia of 95bpm and a quiet systolic flow murmur not radiating to the carotids. Abdominal examination reveals no palpable masses, and examination of his lungs is completely normal.\n\nThe GP had previously arranged a 24h urinary catecholamine test; results are as follows:\n\nTotal urine catecholamines 210mcg/24hr. This is raised.\n\nAs a follow up to this test the GP had arranged a CT of the patient's abdomen and pelvis which is reported as normal apart from a few incidental simple renal cysts.\n\nUrinalysis in clinic today shows:\n\nLeucocytes\n\n-\n\nBlood\n\n-\n\nGlucose\n\n+\n\nKetones\n\n-\n\nWhich test is most likely to elucidate the cause of the patient's hypertension?\n\n- a) Pentagastrin stimulation test\n- b) 24h urinary HIAA\n- c) MRI renal angiography\n- d) GH, IGF-1 and 'gut hormones'\n- e) MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan\n\nThis question tests the candidates knowledge of causes of secondary hypertension.

Therefore the pentagastrin stimulation test, where one injects the patient with pentagastrin and looks for an abnormally high release of calcitonin as a response, is not a suitable first test. It may well be considered if the patient is diagnosed with a phaeochromocytoma to rule out medullary thyroid cancer as part of MEN 2.\n\nThe patient does have a few features consistent with carcinoid syndrome, for example the episodic flushing and increased stool frequency. However carcinoid syndrome doesn't present with these symptoms until it has metastasised to the liver, and this patient has had a normal CT scan of his abdomen making this a less likely diagnosis.\n\nMRI renal angiography is used to diagnose renal artery stenosis; this patient has far too many other endocrine features for this to be renal artery stenosis. In addition the fact his blood pressure has not got worse with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors makes the diagnosis less likely.\n\nTesting for gut hormones would be done in a patient in whom you were considering a diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasm as part of MEN1.\n\nThis leaves the MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan. The patient has raised levels of total urinary catecholamines, suggesting a diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma, however, his CT scan show's no evidence. As you may be aware there is a rule of 10 that is commonly used to describe phaeochromocytoma, in that:\n\n10% are malignant\n\n10% are bilateral\n\n10% are familial\n\n10% are in children\n\n10% are extra-adrenal\n\nThe other sites that phaeochromocytomas can present include: Anywhere alone the sympathetic chain which runs alongside the spinal cord, the distal aorta, ureters and urinary bladder.\n\nThe MIBG scan uses radioactive iodine as a tracer for phaeochromocytoma tumour cells, which is detected through the use of a gamma camera., making it the next test that should be used in diagnosing this patient's phaeochromocytoma, i.e. the cause of his hypertension.\n\nKumar &amp; Clark's Clinical Medicine Eight Edition page 778"

Prinzmetal's angina is therefore the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAcute NSTEMI is excluded by the normal serial troponins.\n\nAngina pectoris (stable or unstable) is of course a possibility. However the presence of ST elevation, the relatively young age of the patient, and the absence of cardiovascular risk factors, makes Prinzmetal's angina the more likely diagnosis.\n\nThe patient will need coronary angiography. The gold standard test for diagnosing variant angina is to visualise the coronary arteries by angiography before and after injection of a provocative agent such as acetylcholine to precipitate an attack of vasospasm"

An ECG is performed in the department:\n\nWhat is the likely cause of this ECG abnormality?\n\n\n\n- a) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)\n- b) Hyperkalaemia\n- c) Hypokalaemia\n- d) Hypothermia\n- e) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n\nThe ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm with a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute. There are prominent U waves following the T wave.\n\nHypokalaemia is correct. The electrocardiographic features are most in keeping with hypokalaemia. U waves are present and classic of hypokalemia, however, it is important to remember that they can be present in other conditions (e.g. bradycardia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypothermia and raised intracranial pressure). Other ECG features of hypokalaemia include small or absent T waves (occasionally inversion), prolonged PR interval, ST depression, and long QTc.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is incorrect. ARVD is characterised by an epsilon wave which is a small deflection buried at the end of the QRS complex usually best seen in the ST segment of V1 and V2.\n\nHyperkalaemia is incorrect. ECG features of hyperkalaemia include peaked T waves, P wave widening/flattening, PR prolongation, bradyarrhythmias, and QRS widening with bizarre QRS morphology.\n\nHypothermia is incorrect. Hypothermia classically presents with sinus bradycardia and Osborn waves (J wave) defined as positive deflection seen at the J point in precordial and true limb leads. Osborn waves are characteristically seen in hypothermia, however, they are not pathognomonic and can be seen in other conditions such as hypercalcaemia and myocarditis.\n\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is incorrect. This condition is associated with a short PR interval (&lt; 120ms), broad QRS (&gt; 100ms), and a slurred upstroke to the QRS complex (the delta wave)."

Most cardiologists would choose a DDDR pacemaker since many of these patients go onto develop AV block\n\nThe 7 day holter confirms symptomatic sinus bradycardia and an episode of sinus arrest (absence of P wave for &gt; 3 seconds). This confirms the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome.\n\nSick sinus syndrome can be difficult to manage, as it can present with bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or a mixture of both. Bradyarrhythmias can be well controlled with pacemakers, while tachyarrhythmias respond well to rate limiting drugs such as calcium channel blockers, digoxin and beta blockers. However drugs to control tachyarrhythmia may exacerbate bradyarrhythmias. Therefore, a pacemaker is often implanted before drug therapy is begun for the tachyarrhythmia.\n\nThis patient has been having symptomatic bradycardia episodes secondary to sinoatrial node disease. Therefore an AAIR pacemaker is indicated. AAI pacemakers both sense and pace the atria. They are useful for isolated sinoatrial node disease. These are not suitable in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nVVI pacemakers will both sense and pace the ventricle. VVI or VVR pacemakers are useful for pure sustained slow atrial fibrillation.\n\nBiventricular pacemakers are used in heart failure with left bundle branch block.\n\nBisoprolol is a rate limiting drug which would worsen the bradycardia and the patients symptoms."

As above, diltiazem is more appropriate than bisoprolol due to this patient's asthma.\n\nWarfarin + diltiazem is the incorrect answer. As above, a DOAC is preferable to warfarin in this situation. Diltiazem is the correct drug for rate control in this scenario.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve"

The ECG findings are unique to Wellens Syndrome in which there is a critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. These patients are at risk of imminent occlusion of this artery and should be admitted for coronary angiography and further intervention. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has ST elevation in the apical leads (V5, V6). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically has T wave inversion in the anteroseptal leads. Brugada has ST elevation and T wave inversion in V1-V2. Biphasic T-waves are not a normal variant."

He has suffered from angina for several years and finds his glyceryl trinitrate spray effective, but he is keen on further treatment to help his symptoms.\n\nHis past medical history includes angina, asthma, and type 2 diabetes. His current medication includes salbutamol, montelukast, Fostair, metformin, amlodipine, glyceryl trinitrate, aspirin and simvastatin.\n\nObservations are temperature 37\u00baC, heart rate 52 beats/min, blood pressure 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96%.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate additional therapy?\n\n- a) Bisoprolol\n- b) Isosorbide mononitrate\n- c) Ivabradine\n- d) Ranolazine\n- e) Verapamil1\n\nFor a patient with symptomatic stable angina on a calcium channel blocker but with a contraindication to a beta-blocker, the next line treatment should be longacting nitrate, ivabradine, nicorandil or ranolazine\n\nThe correct answer is ranolazine . This patient has stable angina despite the use of first-line anti-anginal therapy with amlodipine. NICE recommends using either a beta-blocker or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as first-line antianginal.\n\nThere are a number of options for next-line treatment for patients on a calcium channel blocker, including the addition of a beta-blocker, long-acting nitrate, ivabradine, nicorandil or ranolazine. In this case, ranolazine would be the most appropriate, as the other options have either cautions or contra-indications.\n\nGiven that this patient has asthma, it would be best practice to avoid a betablocker such as bisoprolol , especially if other equally appropriate therapy options are available.\n\nGiven that this patient already has a slightly low blood pressure on the candesartan alone, it would be best to avoid adding in isosorbide mononitrate as this risks dropping the blood pressure further.\n\nIvabradine is contra-indicated in bradycardia. The BNF states 'do not initiate for angina if heart rate below 70 beats per minute'.\n\nThe patient is already on a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, therefore adding a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil should be avoided.\n\nDiscuss (4)Improve"

The INR (derived from the PT) is used to monitor warfarin since it is the most representative, however, it is important to remember that warfarin can also prolong the APTT.\n\nIntravenous 3mg vitamin K is correct. The patient has a minor bleed with an INR &gt;8.0. Thus the warfarin should be withheld and the patient should receive intravenous vitamin K 1-3mg. The warfarin should be restarted when the INR &lt; 5.0.\n\nFresh frozen plasma is incorrect. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not recommended for use as a warfarin reversal agent as it can take hours to work due to the volume required. In warfarin-associated major haemorrhages, FFP should only be given if prothrombin complex concentrate is unavailable.\n\nIntravenous 10mg vitamin K is incorrect. For minor haemorrhage, the dose of intravenous vitamin K recommended is 1-3mg.\n\nPlatelet transfusion is incorrect. In the context of haemorrhage, a platelet level of &lt;50 is the standard transfusion trigger, with the exclusion of CNS or posterior eye bleeds in which the transfusion trigger is &lt;100. The patient in this clinical case has a platelet count of 72 and thus does not require a platelet transfusion.\n\nProthrombin complex concentrate is incorrect. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is recommended only for major bleeding. PCC will reverse anticoagulation within minutes of administration however administration of vitamin K is also required to counteract the long half-life of warfarin."

She continued to experience significant shortness of breath at rest with exercise tolerance that was limited to a few steps around the house. She had a previous medical history of hypertension, diabetes and myocardial infarction 5 years previously treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Her medications comprised of bisoprolol 10mg, ramipril 10mg, furosemide 80mg twice daily, spironolactone 25mg, simvastatin 40mg, metformin 1g twice daily and aspirin 75mg. On examination she appeared breathless, the jugular venous pressure was elevated at 7cm, there were bibasal fine crepitations and moderate pitting oedema to her knees. Her heart rate was 68 beats per minute and blood pressure was 95/65mmHg.\n\n## Investigations:\n\nHaemoglobin\n\n115 g/L\n\nWhite cell count\n\n5.6 x10^9/L\n\nPlatelet Count\n\n268 x10^9/L\n\nSerum sodium\n\n132mmol/L\n\nSerum potassium\n\n4.3mmol/L\n\nSerum urea\n\n6.7mmol/L\n\nSerum creatinine\n\n68micromol/L\n\nElectrocardiogram: normal sinus rhythm. Rate 65 beats per minute. QRS duration\n\n155ms. No acute ST changes.\n\nEchocardiography: left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. No significant valvular abnormalities.\n\nCoronary angiography: Patent left anterior descending coronary artery stent. Minor diffuse coronary artery disease.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next management step?\n\n- a) Increase dose of furosemide\n- b) Cardiac resynchronisation therapy\n- c) Coronary artery bypass graft\n- d) Start amlodipine\n- e) Home oxygen\n\nThis lady has ischaemic heart disease with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 4 heart failure and is on maximal medical therapy. Her ECG shows a wide QRS complex which suggests ventricular dyssynchrony (i.e. The left and right ventricle are not beating at the same time). Resynchronisation of the ventricles with cardiac resynchronisation therapy with a paced device (CRT-P) involves simultaneous stimulation of both ventricles to reduce dyssynchrony and therefore increase cardiac output.\n\nNice supports the use of CRT-P in patients with:\n\n- \uf0b7 NYHA class three or four symptoms\n- \uf0b7 They are in normal sinus rhythm with either\n- \uf0b7 \u2192 QRS duration of 150 ms or longer estimated by standard electrocardiogram (ECG)\n- \uf0b7 \u2192 QRS duration of 120-149 ms estimated by ECG and mechanical dyssynchrony that is confirmed by echocardiography.\n- \uf0b7 They have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less.\n- \uf0b7 They are receiving optimal pharmacological therapy.\n\nIn this selected group of patients, it has been shown to improve symptoms by a reduction of about one NYHA classification, reduce hospitalisations and reduce mortality. These devices can be fitted with an implantable cardiac defibrillator (i.e. A CRT-D where the D stands for defibrillator as opposed to a CRT-P where P stands for paced and thus this device lacks the defibrillator component) for primary or secondary prophylaxis against ventricular dysrhythmias.\n\nIncreasing her dose of furosemide is unlikely to significantly improve her symptoms and is, therefore, an incorrect answer. Coronary artery bypass grafting has greater benefit than percutaneous coronary intervention at treating multivessel disease, however, this lady has disease of the left anterior descending artery which has been previously treated and only minor disease in her other coronary vessels; therefore this is an incorrect answer. She is hypotensive and therefore starting amlodipine is inappropriate. Home oxygen can be used for the palliation of shortness of breath in heart failure and is not appropriate in this case."

The majority of patients with mitral valve prolapse with be asymptomatic but when symptoms are present mitral valve prolapse has to be considered and investigated with an echocardiogram.\n\nThe 'click' coupled with the knowledge of the underlying ADPKD makes the murmur heard in this patient that of a mitral valve prolapse. The prolapse can worsen and cause a secondary mitral regurgitation leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath. The narrow pulse pressure present also suggests an element of left ventricular dysfunction."

There is no history of fever or diarrhoea.\n\nOn examination, she appears lethargic with dry mucous membranes. Chest sounds are clear and heart sounds are normal. Her abdomen is soft with generalised tenderness mostly within the epigastric region.\n\nHer blood glucose is recorded as 7.4 mmol/L. An ECG is taken on arrival at the emergency department, as shown below:\n\nWhat is the recommended initial management for this patient?\n\n\n\n- a) Intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride with 40 mmol potassium\n- b) Intravenous 1.26% sodium bicarbonate\n- c) Intravenous calcium gluconate\n- d) Intravenous magnesium sulphate\n- e) Warmed intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride\n\nThis patient's ECG shows U waves that are most noticeable in leads V2 and V3. U waves are small positive deflections that appear shortly after a T wave and frequently represent hypokalaemia. There is also a prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 440ms). Other features of severe hypokalaemia include increased P wave amplitude, PR interval prolongation and T wave flattening.\n\nIntravenous 0.9% sodium chloride with 40 mmol potassium is correct. There are several causes of U waves including hypothermia, bradycardia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and severe hypokalaemia. There are also multiple causes of a prolonged QTc interval including hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypothermia. Given the presentation of prolonged vomiting in a patient with type 1 diabetes (likely representing gastroparesis), this patient is at high risk for having hypokalaemia. The clinical history and ECG are suggestive of hypokalaemia and therefore intravenous potassium replacement is necessary.\n\nIntravenous 1.26% sodium bicarbonate is incorrect. Sodium bicarbonate 1.26% can be administered in instances of metabolic acidosis and certain arrhythmias (eg broad complex tachycardia associated with salicylate overdose). It is not indicated for this patient.\n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate is indicated for severe hypocalcaemia and hyperkalaemia with ECG changes such as tall tented T waves, QRS widening and flattened P waves. Although hypocalcaemia can cause a prolonged QTc interval which is seen here, it is a less common cause of U waves making calcium gluconate a less appropriate drug to administer.\n\nIntravenous magnesium sulphate is given in the management of acute arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and Torsades de Pointes (a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QTc prolongation). Although hypomagnesaemia can cause QTc prolongation, it is a less common cause of U waves in comparison to hypokalaemia, making potassium replacement the most appropriate initial management. However, it is important to remember that a normal magnesium level is required for the maintenance of a potassium level within the normal range and, therefore, replacement may also be necessary.\n\nWarmed intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride is incorrect. Hypothermia is a less common cause of U waves and QTc prolongation and more commonly produces J waves which are not seen here. Secondly, there is no indication from the clinical presentation that this patient is hypothermic."

Tricyclic anti-depressants are associated with prolongation of QTc interval. Other medications that can cause this include quinidine, erythromycin, digoxin, amiodarone and lithium.

His peripheral pulses are present bilaterally with a capillary refill time of &lt; 2 seconds. There is no postural drop in blood pressure and his neurological examination is unremarkable.\n\nAn ECG is taken, as shown below:\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?\n\n\n\n- a) Aortic stenosis\n- b) Hypercalcaemia\n- c) Hypokalaemia\n- d) Left ventricular hypertrophy\n- e) Pulmonary embolism\n\nThis patient's ECG demonstrates right bundle branch block (RBBB) with an RSR pattern in leads V1-V3 (creating an 'M-shaped' QRS complex), with wide slurred S waves in the leads I, aVL, V5-V6 (creating a 'W-shaped' QRS complex). A widened QRS interval (i.e. &gt; 120ms) is also a feature of RBBB. There are multiple causes of RBBB and in some cases, it may be found incidentally as a normal variant. However, pathological causes commonly include increased right heart strain (e.g. right ventricular hypertrophy, cor pulmonale or pulmonary embolism). Given the history of malignancy, collapse and shortness of breath, a pulmonary embolism is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation to the hospital and ECG findings of RBBB.\n\nWhilst aortic stenosis can cause the symptoms of collapse and breathlessness, it is not common for aortic stenosis to cause RBBB. Rather, aortic stenosis may be responsible for the appearance of left bundle branch block (LBBB) or left ventricular hypertrophy on an ECG.\n\nThe most common ECG finding in hypercalcaemia is QT interval shortening. In severe hypercalcaemia (&gt; 3.4mmol/L) J waves may be seen. Although hypercalcaemia is more likely to be present in a patient with a diagnosis of malignancy, it would not be responsible for this patient's RBBB and is unlikely to be the underlying diagnosis.\n\nHypokalaemia causes the following ECG changes: prolonged PR interval, widespread ST depression and T wave flattening or inversion and prominent U waves (most clearly in leads V2-V3). It does not cause RBBB and is, therefore, incorrect.\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has numerous causes, most commonly hypertension. There are lots of specific voltage criteria to be met to accurately diagnose LVH on an ECG including:\n\n- \uf0b7 R wave in V4, V5 or V6 &gt; 26mm\n- \uf0b7 R wave in V5 or V6 plus S wave in V1 &gt; 35 mm\n- \uf0b7 Largest R wave plus largest S wave in precordial leads &gt; 45 mm\n\nAdditional features include left axis deviation and left atrial enlargement. Although this patient has hypertension, there are no features of LVH on his ECG and it is unlikely to cause his episode of syncope, making it the incorrect answer."

The key to this question is recognising which aspects are important and which are not. The patient is clearly euvolaemic and intravenous fluids at this stage are not required. However, it would be prudent to monitor urine output and if significant amounts are produced, to replace output with oral intake or intravenous input. Troponin is raised but this is in the context of an acute on chronic kidney injury. In the context of no reported chest pain and no new dynamic ECG changes, treatment as an acute coronary syndrome is unnecessary. The patient is at greater risk of post-renal injury and his renal function tests should instead be monitored. A long-term catheter is a reasonable suggestion considering the number of failed TURPs."

Type A involves the aortic arch and the aortic valve while type B involves the descending thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. (Stanford Classification)\n\nStanford types A and B are further sub-classified according to the De Bakey classification.\n\nStanford Type A constitutes De Bakey I (extending to the abdominal aorta) and De Bakey II (localised to the ascending aorta). Stanford type B is synonymous with De Bakey type III.\n\nThe importance of these classifications is the difference in treatment. Universally, blood pressure control in mandatory with a target reduction in systolic BP to 120mmHg. Type A dissection should undergo surgery (aortic arch replacement) if the patient is fit enough since medical management alone carries a high risk of mortality (50% within 2 weeks). Type B dissections carry a better prognosis with 89% survival at one month and should thus initially be managed medically, with surgical interventions only if complications develop.\n\nIndications for endovascular stenting include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Rapidly expanding dissections (&gt;1cm per year)\n- \uf0b7 Critical diameter (&gt;5.5cm)\n- \uf0b7 Refractory pain\n- \uf0b7 Malperfusion syndrome\n- \uf0b7 Blunt chest trauma\n- \uf0b7 Penetrating aortic ulcers"

The chest pain and shortness of breath have been worsening over the last week. He is currently undergoing adjunct chemotherapy for a non-resectable soft tissue sarcoma. He has known metastasis in his thorax and mediastinum.\n\n| Hb        | 90 g/L         | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |\n|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Platelets | 100 * 10 9 /L  | (150 - 400)                           |\n| WBC       | 12.3 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |\n\n| Na +         | 131 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |\n|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| K +          | 3.1 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |\n| Bicarbonat e | 19 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |\n| Urea         | 8.0 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |\n| Creatinine   | 145 \u00b5mol/L   | (55 - 120)    |\n\nOn physical examination his JVP is raised at 6cm, there are no precordial thrills, and he has quiet S1 and S2.\n\n## Observations show:\n\n- \uf0b7 Heart rate of 115/min and regular\n- \uf0b7 Blood pressure 95/55mmHg\n- \uf0b7 Respiratory rate 28/min\n- \uf0b7 Temperature 36.5\u00baC\n- \uf0b7 AVPU - A\n\nWhat is the more specific ECG finding associated with this diagnosis?\n\n- a) Electrical alternans\n- b) RBBB\n- c) S1Q3T3\n- d) ST elevation in leads V1-4\n- e) Sinus tachycardia\n\nElectrical alternans is suggestive of cardiac tamponade\n\nElectrical alternans is the correct answer. The patient has metastatic disease within the thorax and mediastinum increasing his risk of a pericardial effusion. Electrical alternans is seen in massive pericardial effusions as an alternating height of QRS complex across the rhythm strip. Other ECG findings to look for are tachycardia and low voltage QRS. The website Life in the Fast Lane has a library of ECGs with examples of this.\n\nRBBB is the incorrect answer because this is not a specific finding for massive pericardial effusion. There are a variety of causes of RBBB. Examples include congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolus, right ventricular hypertrophy, ischaemic heart disease and others. In an acute PE setting, which is a differential, in this case, you would also look for right heart strain due to the sudden increase in right ventricular pressure caused by the obstruction to the pulmonary vasculature.\n\nS1Q3T3 is the incorrect answer as this is associated with a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, this is only seen in approximately 15% of PEs. The more common ECG finding is sinus tachycardia.\n\nST elevation in leads V1-4 is the incorrect answer because this is seen in an anterior occlusive, or type 1, myocardial infarction. This typically affects the left anterior descending artery and confers a high risk of a ventricular arrhythmia. The patient requires urgent PCI or, if that is not available within 120 minutes, then thrombolysis.\n\nSinus tachycardia is the incorrect answer as it is a non-specific finding on ECG. You would expect a patient with a massive pericardial effusion to mount a tachycardic response. This is because a decrease in diastolic relaxation and the subsequent volume of ventricular filling decreases your stroke volume. To maintain an adequate cardiac output, the patient will increase HR. As CO = SV x HR. However, this is a non-specific finding and is seen in all types of shock; septic, cardiogenic, distributive and hypovolaemic. Answer 1 is a much more specific ECG finding.\n\nDiscuss (5)Improve"

He has had numerous admissions this year with heart failure decompensation and is wondering if there is anything else that you can do for him. You review his ECG, which is in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 58/min with a QRS of 98 msec and no signs of intraventricular delay. His blood pressure is: 98/55 mmHg. You also review his bloods:\n\n| Hb         | 129 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |\n|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Platelets  | 335 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |\n| WBC        | 6.8* 10 9 /L  | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |\n| Na +       | 137 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |\n| K +        | 4.7 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |\n| Urea       | 5.4 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)                           |\n| Creatinine | 125 \u00b5mol/L    | (55 - 120)                            |\n\nHe is currently on carvedilol 25 mg BD, enalapril 10 mg BD, bumetanide 2 mg BD, aspirin 75 mg, ivabradine 2.5 mg BD, spironolactone 25 mg OD.\n\nWhat alteration to this gentleman's medications could potentially decrease this gentleman's probability of being re-admitted?\n\n- a) Increase ivabradine\n- b) Add sacubitril/valsartan\n- c) Increase spironolactone\n- d) Stop enalapril - initiate sacubitril/valsartan\n- e) Increase bumetanide\n\nSacubitril-valsartan should be initiated following ACEi or ARB wash-out period\n\nThis gentleman poses the issue of long-standing management of heart-failure. The ESC guidelines advice strictly on the uptitration of medication up to their maximal desired effect taking in consideration the patient's status - the frontline medications include ACE inhibitors, b-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The patient is on all three. If the patient remains symptomatic then a good choice would be dependable on their QRS morphology with a CRT-P device being appropriate in certain cases (e.g. QRS &gt;130 msec) or ivabradine in someone with a heart rate of more than 70/min. The option of digoxin is also discussed in the ESC guidelines.\n\nHowever the patient above is already bradycardic and hypotensive with a slightly raised potassium therefore making the possibility of increasing any of his current medications less appealing. In these patients the possibility of introducing sacubitril/valsartan is appropriate, however it is important for the clinician to be aware of the need for a wash-out period between the ACEi and the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan. The wash-out period advised is that of 36 hours.\n\nThe increase in diuretic might appear appealing, there is no evidence that diuretics improve mortality rates in such patients. The PARADIGM-HF trial that was comparing sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril indicated that sacubitril/valsartan was superior to enalapril in reducing cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation and 30-day hospital readmission in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.\n\nDiscuss (6)Improve"

He started taking atorvastatin two months ago due to a routine assessment of QRISK and elevated cholesterol levels. He had a blood test as requested at three months following the start of treatment.\n\nThese shows that his alanine aminotransferase have increased from 28iU/L to 94iU/L. Other blood tests have remained within normal ranges apart from cholesterol which as improved from 5.4mmol/L to 4.9mmol/L.\n\n## How should his atorvastatin treatment be managed?\n\n- a) Stop atorvastatin and repeat LFT within 4-6 weeks\n- b) Continue atorvastatin and repeat LFT within 4-6 weeks\n- c) Change atorvastatin to simvastatin\n- d) Investigate for elevated creatinine kinase\n- e) Stop atorvastatin and arrange for an urgent abdominal ultrasound\n\nThe correct answer is to continue atorvastatin and repeat LFT within 4-6 weeks. This patient has developed elevated transaminases following starting a statin, but these are within three times the upper range of normal. Please note that this is three times the maximum normal range, not three times above the patient's baseline result. Therefore it is acceptable to continue atorvastatin but monitor liver function with a repeat test in 4-6 weeks. If the level had been greater than three times the normal upper range then stopping the atorvastatin and repeating LFT would have been appropriate. There is no need to arrange for an ultrasound at the moment as there is a clear explanation, and there is no evidence of new muscle pain to justify testing for creatinine kinase. Changing statin can play a role if the statin is not tolerated, but that is not the case so far."

He advises you that he has had worsening shortness of breath over the last few weeks. He is now symptomatic at rest. His regular medications include ramipril, bisoprolol, furosemide and eplerenone. His observations are as follows: heart rate 70 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and SpO2 94% on air. On examination, you note pitting oedema to the mid calves and bilateral coarse crepitations.\n\nAn echocardiogram and ECG is performed:\n\nLeft ventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 25%\n\nWhat treatment is most likely to be beneficial to long-term survival?\n\n- a) Bendroflumethiazide\n- b) Bumetanide\n- c) Cardiac resynchronisation therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D)\n- d) Cardiac resynchronisation therapy with pacing (CRT- P)\n- e) Ivabradine\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nCardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used in patients with a QRS duration of &gt;130 msec and LBBB morphology to improve symptomatology\n\nThe patient has symptomatic (NYHA class IV) cardiac failure requiring escalation of treatment. He is already on an ACE-I, beta blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and loop diuretic. He has severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) with an ejection fraction of 25%. It is important to note the presence of LBBB with a significantly prolonged QRS. The dominant S wave in V1 and a broad monophasic R wave in the lateral leads are classic of LBBB.\n\nCardiac resynchronisation therapy with pacing (CRT- P) is correct. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is recommended as a treatment option for people with heart failure who have left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less, and LBBB with a QRS duration &gt; 130 msec. The patient in this clinical case, therefore, fulfils these criteria. Many randomised controlled trials have shown that CRT significantly prolongs survival in patients with heart failure. The NICE guidelines have criteria on whether to choose CRT-D or CRT-P. In patients with NYHA class IV (as seen in this case), CRT-P is the preferred modality. In this case, it would also be important to consider the use of sacubitril/valsartan. The PROVE-HF trial (as well as case reports and observational studies) have shown that sacubitril/valsartan is able to induce reverse cardiac remodeling, which has the potential to avoid ICD or CRT implantation.\n\nBendroflumethiazide is incorrect. Bendroflumethiazide can be used for mild or moderate heart failure. Although diuretics can have major benefits for patient symptomatology, they have no benefit to long-term survival.\n\nBumetanide is incorrect. Bumetanide is a type of loop diuretic which has been shown to have greater bioavailability compared to furosemide due to increased absorption in patients who have oedematous bowels. Although diuretics can have major benefits for patient symptomatology, they have no benefit to long-term survival.\n\nCardiac resynchronisation therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) is incorrect. As the patient has NYHA class IV symptomatology, CRT-P is the correct option as per NICE guidelines.\n\nIvabradine is incorrect. Ivabradine is recommended as an option for treating chronic heart failure for patients who are in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute or more and who are already on standard therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. The patient in this clinical case has a heart rate of 70 beats per minute and ivabradine is therefore not indicated.\n\nDiscuss (4)Improve"

Current guidelines advise that in the absence of any clear contraindications, patients with poorly controlled hypertension already taking an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker should be offered a thiazide-like diuretic. Thiazide-like diuretics are sulfonamide-based diuretics that have similar pharmacological properties to thiazides but have been shown in recent trials to reduce systolic blood pressure more effectively than conventional thiazides, without a significant difference in side-effect profile. Indapamide is the only thiazide-like diuretic provided in the answer choices.\n\nBendroflumethiazide is incorrect as thiazide-like diuretics, rather than thiazide diuretics such as bendroflumethiazide now tend to be preferred as third-line antihypertensive therapy in most patients for the reasons outlined above.\n\nBisoprolol is incorrect.

Alpha blockade with doxazosin would be another option for a patient with persistent hypertension already taking a calcium channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide-like diuretic with serum potassium &gt; 4.5mmol/L.\n\nSpironolactone is incorrect. Aldosterone receptor antagonism with spironolactone may be offered to patients with persistent hypertension despite taking a calcium channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide-like diuretic with serum potassium &lt; 4.5mmol/L, due to the propensity of spironolactone to cause hyperkalaemia.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve"

Age will be considered alongside other co-morbidities and functional baseline when deciding if she will be suitable for a general anaesthetic for the procedure.\n\nThe loudness of a murmur typically doesn't impact the decision to proceed with\n\n## surgery.\n\nEjection fraction becomes relevant in asymptomatic patients. 2017 European society of cardiology (ESC) and European association for cardiothoracic surgery (EACTS) guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease suggest that replacement should be considered in asymptomatic patients with an ejection fraction of less than 60%.\n\nDiscuss (3)Improve"

It appears to be constant for the past 3 hours since onset and is his first ever episode. His past medical history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and one previous transient ischaemic attack.\n\nHis ECG demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria and T-wave inversion in I, aVF and V5 and V6. On examination, his heart sounds are both present with a soft systolic murmur. The chest is clear and abdomen is soft and non-tender without a pulsatile mass. Both radial pulses are intact with no delay. There is a mild radio-femoral delay. His blood pressure is stable at 134/80 mmHg, heart rate 124/min and sinus rhythm. His bloods are as follows:\n\n| Hb         | 123 g/l                 |\n|------------|-------------------------|\n| MCV        | 82 fl                   |\n| Platelets  | 204 * 10 9 /l           |\n| WBC        | 9.2 * 10 9 /l           |\n| Troponin T | 240 (normal range < 32) |\n\nHis pain settles transiently with 2.5mg of subcutaneous morphine.

The clue lies in the distal pulses: the lack of radial-radial delay suggests any aortic pathology occurs below the subclavian artery origin. The mild radial-femoral delay suggests a descending artery lesion. The patient is unwell but not actively exsanguinating as evidenced by the stable Hb and blood pressure. An underlying diagnosis of acute aortic syndrome, a new term classifying all acute aortic pathology including dissections, ulcers and aneurysms, must be ruled out by high definition CT aorta with contrast.\n\nDiscuss (4)Improve"

He is noted to have a blood pressure of 95/63mmHg and a heart rate of 98bpm. An ECG confirms sinus rhythm. He has previously developed symptoms of wheeze with beta blockade. He is commenced on ivabradine 5mg twice daily by his cardiologist.\n\nWhich of the following should the patient be warned of as a recognised side effect of ivabradine?\n\n- f) Neutrophilia\n- g) Hypotension\n- h) Phosphenes\n- i) Diaphoresis\n- j) Renal failure\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nIvabradine use may be associated with visual disturbances including phosphenes and green luminescence\n\nIvabradine is a second line agent for rate control in the treatment of chronic heart failure in those in whom beta-blockade is contraindicated, not tolerated or therapy fails. Other rate limiting drugs such as the calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil may sometimes be used but hypotension often limits their use. Digoxin too can sometimes be used, even in sinus rhythm although the rate limiting effect it has is relatively modest; often digoxin and ivabradine are ultimately used in conjunction.\n\nNICE guidelines on the use of ivabradine give clear criteria on its use; the patient must have at least a moderate degree of heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fracture of &lt;35%, they must be stable on optimal doses of other heart failure medications including angiotensin system modulators, an aldosterone receptor antagonist and a beta blocker if not contraindicated. It is important the patient is regularly monitored by a community heart failure team to titrate the dose. Ivabradine can also only be used in patients in sinus rhythm. It works by selectively inhibiting the If [ionic funny] channel which is a sodium/potassium symporter channel largely expressed within the sinoatrial node. Inhibition of this channel slows the intrinsic rhythmicity of the hearts pacemaker function. Pharmaceutical bradycardia aids in the management of cardiac failure as it allows improved diastolic filling and reduced myocardial oxygen usage.\n\nSide effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, ventricular escape rhythms, dizziness, headache, muscle cramps and eosinophilia. Neutrophilia is rarely seen with ivabradine. Hypotension is also not seen with ivabradine use which makes it an important drug in the arsenal when treating patients with cardiac failure in whom other rate limiting drugs may be relatively contraindicated.\n\nAn important side effect with ivabradine however is that of visual disturbance including the phenomenon of phosphenes, or 'flashing lights'. Other visual symptoms described include green discolouration of visual field, blurring of vision and scintillating scotomata. These visual symptoms are usually transient and mild. They arise due to inhibition of similar ionic channels in the retina to the sinoatrial If channels. Approximately 20% of patients taking the drug develop some form of visual disturbance but only 1% need to discontinue therapy because of it.\n\nThe use of ivabradine in renal dysfunction is not well established however manufacturers recommend it may be used with estimated glomerular filtration rates above 15ml/min. There is no evidence its use causes renal dysfunction although mild rises in plasma creatinine levels may be seen."

On questioning he confirms his symptoms of breathlessness are often worse during and post these chest infections.\n\nHe has a past medical history of chronic renal artery stenosis and resultant poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple medications including an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker and a diuretic.\n\nAn ECG is performed as seen below.\n\nWhat is the patient's most likely diagnosis?\n\n- f) Brugada syndrome\n- g) Hyperkalaemia\n- h) Left ventricular hypertrophy\n- i) Pericarditis\n- j) Wellen's syndrome\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThis patient has presented with symptoms and typical ECG changes in keeping with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The thickening of the cardiac muscle is most likely a result of chronic uncontrolled hypertension, hence the prolonged, progressive history. LV hypertrophy results in signs and symptoms of LV failure including breathlessness, angina and reduced exercise tolerance. The patient's ECG demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with ST elevation in V2-3, without reciprocal lead changes and the combination of the S wave in V1 with the R wave in V5 or V6 clearly exceeding 40 mm.\n\nBrugada syndrome is a genetic cardiac disorder resulting in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death. There are several types of Brugada syndrome with variation seen on ECG\n\nhowever the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as Brugada sign.\n\nThere is no clear reason why this patient would be hyperkalaemia. Although he has renal impairment it is not indicated that he has end-stage renal failure or that he is on renal replacement therapy therefore hyperkalaemia would not be expected. Common ECG changes noted in hyperkalaemia included peaked T waves, P wave widening/flattening, PR prolongation progressing to the bradyarrhythmias and conductions blocks. No clear features of hyperkalaemia can be seen on this patient's ECG.\n\nPericarditis is inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart and can be due to infections. Patients normally present with pleuritic, constant chest pain and fevers. Although this patient has a very recent chest infection, pericarditis normally develops a few weeks post the resolution of infection as it is an immune response and not a direct result of the infection itself. ECG findings associated with pericarditis include widespread concave ST elevation and PR depression which are not present on this patient's ECG.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic like symptoms. You would expect the patient's chest pain to be continuous and to be more severe if he was experiencing stenosis of the LAD."

Shortly after she arrives in hospital the pain resolves and a second ECG is entirely normal. She has had three similar episodes of chest pain in the past. All episodes of chest pain have come on at rest. Blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, heart rate is 90 beats per minute and hearts sounds are normal. She underwent coronary angiography following a previous episode of chest pain three weeks ago, which showed no significant coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram is normal.\n\n## What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n- f) Acute anterolateral myocardial infarction\n- g) Crescendo angina\n- h) Da Costas syndrome\n- i) Prinzmetal's variant angina\n- j) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\n## Correct answer is d.\n\nThis woman is likely to be suffering from Prinzmetal's variant angina. Classically her pain occurs at rest and the ECG demonstrates ST segment elevation that disappears as the pain abates. Normal coronary angiography supports this diagnosis, however in many Prinzmetal's angina patients there is co-existing coronary artery disease. Symptoms and ECG changes are unlikely to be reproduced with exercise testing in Prinzmetal's angina.\n\nPrinzmetal's angina is caused by coronary artery spasm, however the underlying pathophysiology causing spasm is not currently well understood. In some patients it is associated with other vasospastic disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\nThe main stay of treatment is:\n\n- \uf0b7 Avoiding precipitants of spasm such as smoking.\n- \uf0b7 Calcium channel blockers, nitrates and/or nicorandil."

The patient's immediate post-operative recovery had been unremarkable and he had begun to mobilise with the ward physiotherapist. Routine observations recorded on the ward had been unremarkable during the previous 24 hours.\n\nDuring her drug round, the patient's nurse saw the patient suddenly become unable to breathe and clutch at his chest. After calling for help the nurse went to her patient and found him to be in cardiac arrest. Resuscitations attempts were initiated following advanced life-support protocol. Please see the below table for a summary of the patient's electrical rhythm and treatments administered during the initial phases of the resuscitation attempt.\n\nThe patient was noted to be in good physical health with his only comorbidity being hypertension, well controlled with medication. The patient's admission clerking recorded that he was a retired schoolteacher who lived independently at home with his wife. A review of the patient's drug chart indicated that he had been receiving subcutaneous enoxaparin as prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism, but that the patient had refused to wear compression stockings during his admission as he found them uncomfortable.\n\n|   Number of rhythm check | Result of rhythm check        | Treatment administered   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                        1 | Pulseless electrical activity | IV adrenaline 1 mg       |\n\n|   Number of rhythm check | Result of rhythm check            | Treatment administered   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                        2 | Ventricular fibrillation (coarse) | DC shock 150 J           |\n|                        3 | Ventricular fibrillation          | ???                      |\n\nIn addition to a further DC shock, what is the appropriate choice of IV drug treatment following the third rhythm check?\n\n- f) IV adrenaline 1 mg\n- g) IV atropine 400 micrograms &amp; IV amiodarone 300 mg\n- h) No IV drug treatment indicated\n- i) IV adrenaline 1 mg &amp; IV amiodarone 300 mg\n- j) IV atropine 400 micrograms\n\n## Correct answer is a.\n\nThe advanced life support algorithm for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole requires adrenaline to be given immediately and then continued every 3 to 5 minutes (in practice, after every second rhythm check). By contrast, the algorithm for ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VF / VT) requires IV adrenaline to not be given until after the third shock and then continued every 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nHowever, once adrenaline has been given during a resuscitation attempt it should be given every 3-5 minutes even if the type of rhythm changes from PEA/asystole to VF / VT, even if this is only the second cycle of the rhythm being VF / VT (as in the example in the question).\n\nAs part of the VF / VT algorithm, IV amiodarone 300 mg should be given after three defibrillation attempts. A further dose of IV amiodarone 150 mg should be considered after a total of five defibrillation attempts. Atropine is not used as part of the advanced life-support algorithm."

NICE recommend the use of a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker (CCB) first-line. As this patient has been commenced on bisoprolol already, the next step is to add a CCB. A dihydropyridine CCB should be used, to avoid reducing the heart rate further, and so amlodipine is the most appropriate option here.\n\nIsosorbide mononitrate would be appropriate to use as a third agent, if the combination of a beta-blocker and CCB was not adequate. However, at this stage, a CCB should be added.\n\nSimilarly, ivabradine , which modulates the 'funny current', would be appropriate as a third agent instead of isosorbide mononitrate. A CCB should be added first, as this patient is only on bisoprolol.\n\nNicorandil is another alternative agent to be added third, instead of isosorbide mononitrate or ivabradine. It would not be appropriate to add currently, as the patient is only on bisoprolol.\n\nVerapamil is a non-dihydropyridine CCB.

This is a gentleman with symptomatic, but not decompensating, permanent AF which is not responding to first-line treatment with a beta-blocker (bisoprolol). NICE advises that first line treatment for a ratecontrol strategy in AF should be either a beta-blocker or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker, but digoxin can be considered for non-paroxysmal AF in patients who are not very active. If the first-line treatment fails, either with continuing symptoms or poor response of ventricular rate then a combination therapy with any of the following two can be used: beta-blocker, diltiazem, digoxin. Amiodarone, dronedarone and left atrial ablation are all strategies for cardioversion. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker but is used in hypertension rather than in AF as it is not rate-limiting, and would therefore not help."

ARVD can present as palpitations, syncope, or sudden cardiac death similar to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Over time, the right ventricular myocardium is replaced by fibrofatty tissue and patients develop signs of right ventricular failure. This patient's echocardiogram finding of a hypokinetic right ventricular wall is suggestive of the diagnosis. The most characteristic ECG finding in ARVD is an epsilon wave . An epsilon wave is a positive deflection following the end of the QRS complex caused by post-excitation of right ventricular myocytes.\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is a common ECG finding of HOCM. HOCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death and can also present with palpitations and syncope, as seen in this patient. However, this patient's echocardiogram findings are in keeping with ARVD, of which the epsilon wave is the most characteristic ECG finding.\n\nAn Osborn wave (or J wave) is a positive deflection at the J point . There are multiple causes, of which the most common is hypothermia. Other causes of J waves include left ventricular hypertrophy and Brugada syndrome. However, an Osborn wave is not associated with ARVD.\n\nThere are multiple causes of right bundle branch block , including right ventricular hypertrophy. In ARVD, rather than hypertrophy of the right ventricle, the myocardium is replaced by fatty tissue. Right bundle branch block is not a sign of ARVD. Instead, the left bundle branch block is more likely to feature on an ECG of a patient with ARVD.\n\nA delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is commonly associated with pre-excitatory activity, such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome.

With reference to the Resuscitation UK guidelines, it has a place as a second line measure to vagal manoeuvres when no 'adverse features' are present. Adenosine works by transiently blocking the AV node by effect on the A1 receptor, causing potassium efflux and hyperpolarisation.\n\nDont be side-tracked by the fact that this patient is asthmatic, yes this is a relative contraindication to the administration of adenosine, but that is not the question. Theophyllines have been known to antagonise adenosine necessitating higher dosages. Dipyridamole blocks the cellular uptake of adenosine, increasing concentration at receptors and potentiating its effect. Adenosine should therefore be used with caution, if at all, in patients taking dipyridamole, and certainly low starting doses should be considered."

The unifying diagnosis is amyloid cardiomyopathy, likely secondary to AL amyloid from B-cell dyscrasia, with cardiac, renal and possibly liver involvement. There is no evidence of a sudden onset cardiac event suggestive of an ischaemic cause. Echocardiogram does not demonstrate ventricular dilation, only impaired function. A 5mm pericardial effusion is not sufficiently significant to cause tamponade.

She has a long history of anxiety and depression, managed by cognitive behavioural therapy. She reported that she had intermittently had episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath for the past 10 years and had attributed this to her anxiety.

The abnormal fibrofatty tissue predisposes to ventricular tachycardia (VT), right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and can cause sudden death. It is often inherited but can be sporadic. Presentation is often with nonspecific palpitations, chest discomfort, and syncope. This patient has a typical presentation: the pregnancyassociated increase in stroke volume is likely the trigger for her symptoms recently worsening. Her two ECGs are characteristic: typical changes include inverted T waves in the precordial leads V1-V3 (looking at the right ventricle) with episodes of ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricle (giving the ECG a LBBB morphology as the arrhythmia takes an abnormal route of conduction from right to left through slowly-conducting myocardium rather than conducting tissue). Epsilon waves may also be seen in ARVC. Her echocardiogram is also characteristic - infiltration and thinning of the right ventricular wall can occur to the point that systolic function is impaired and an aneurysm forms.\n\nNote that the differential for a wide-complex regular tachycardia on an ECG\n\nincludes SVT with aberrant conduction (as well as VT). However, the fusion beats and capture beats are more in keeping with VT in this case.\n\nThis patient's presentation is not typical for aortic dissection. An echo might see cardiac tamponade or new aortic regurgitation if this was the diagnosis but this is not the case here.\n\nTakutsubo cardiomyopathy is caused by transient systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), presenting similarly to an acute coronary syndrome. Patients typically have chest pain, a raised troponin, and ECG findings consistent with ischaemia such as ST elevation/T wave inversion. This is typically triggered by recent physical or emotional stress. Patients are initially managed as an ACS but cardiac angiography shows no significant coronary artery disease. Instead, the LV wall shows hypokinesis or akinesis which creates the shape of an 'octopus pot' during systole. It may be argued that this patient has experienced a recent stressor (the news of pregnancy) however her presentation, long history of symptoms, and echo findings are more in keeping with AVRC.\n\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare type of cardiomyopathy that is often dilated and occurs in late pregnancy or early postpartum (typically one month before or after birth). The aetiology is unclear but is thought to be multifactorial. Criteria for diagnosis of PPCM include impairment of LV systolic function (LVEF &lt;45%) which was not the case in this patient. Furthermore, this patient presented in the early second trimester - too early for PPCM but late enough for pregnancyrelated haemodynamic changes to trigger her underlying ARVC.\n\nLastly, Brugada syndrome is another important differential to consider in young patients with palpitations, ECG changes in V1-V3, and episodes of VT. Brugada is caused by an inherited mutation in the cardiac sodium channel. However, echocardiography is typically normal and an ECG may show unusual ST elevation in V1-V3 with T wave inversion in these lea"

He opens his eyes to pain, localises to pain, and makes incomprehensible sounds. His pulse is palpable at 180 bpm with BP 88/54 mmHg.\n\nECG demonstrates a wide complex monomorphic tachycardia with prolonged QRS 150msec.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next step?\n\n- f) Adrenaline\n- g) Amiodarone\n- h) Magnesium sulphate\n- i) Synchronised DC cardioversion\n- j) Unsynchronised DC cardioversion\n\nCorrect answer is d.\n\nA synchronised cardioversion is the treatment for a unstable patient in VT\n\nSynchronised DC cardioversion is the preferred treatment for tachyarrhythmia in unstable patients displaying life-threatening adverse signs. In this situation, unstable VT with a pulse should be managed with synchronised DC cardioversion. To convert atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the shock must be synchronised to occur with the R wave of the ECG. An unsynchronised shock could coincide with a T wave and cause ventricular fibrillation (VF). Please see adult Advanced Life Support guidelines.\n\nAdrenaline 1mg 1:10000 is used in the ALS algorithm in the treatment of unconscious patients with shockable and non-shockable rhythms. In the ALS algorithm, shockable rhythms include pulseless VT and VF. In this case, the patient is unconscious with VT and a pulse can be felt.\n\nWhile amiodarone can be used to treat ventricular tachycardia, it would not be the most appropriate next step here, as this patient has signs of unstable VT, which must be managed with synchronised DC cardioversion in the first instance. Amiodarone is also used as part of the ALS algorithm for the treatment of patients with pulseless VT or VF. However, given the palpable pulse, synchronised DC cardioversion would be more appropriate here.\n\nMagnesium sulphate is the treatment of choice in broad-complex polymorphic tachycardia. Given this patient is unstable with a monomorphic VT, synchronised DC cardioversion would be the most appropriate next step.\n\nUnsynchronised DC cardioversion would be used in the treatment of patients with pulseless VT or VF. Given the palpable pulse, synchronised DC cardioversion would be more appropriate."

Any drug that increases the delay of the normal conduction pathway via the AV node increases conduction via the accessory pathway, potentially inducing ventricular fibrillation or tachycardias.

Revascularisation has not been shown to reduce mortality or the rate of myocardial infarction in such patients. However, sub-group analysis of randomised controlled trials suggests some benefit for the above outcomes over medical therapy. Therefore, ESC guidelines recommend offering revascularisation to patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischaemia in &gt; 10 % of the left ventricle. Also, the patient's age and lack of co-morbidities make this the most appropriate strategy in this case.\n\nThe other possible answers that are options for the medical management of stable angina are contraindicated in this patient. Both nicorandil and ISMN are contra-indicated for this patient due to his borderline hypotension and use of sildenafil. Ivabradine is contra-indicated due to the patient's history of bradycardia.

The condition is due to a genetic defect that causes a disorder of the cardiac muscle and, although patients can be asymptomatic, it is the commonest cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Patients who do present with symptoms typically experience exertional dyspnoea, angina and syncopal episodes, commonly following or during exertion. ECG findings are of left ventricular hypertrophy, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion and deep Q waves. On this patient's ECG widespread T wave inversion can be seen, especially in lead I &amp; II as well as non-specific STsegment changes in V2 &amp; 3. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cardiac echo and management is dependant on the extent of obstruction and patient symptoms.\n\nBrugada syndrome is another genetic cardiac disorder however unlike HOCM it results in electrical activity disorders and not structural issues. Features include syncope and sudden cardiac death however it is not always associated with exertion or exercise. There are several types of Brugada syndrome, each with variations seen on ECG. However, the only potentially diagnostic ECG abnormality is of coved ST-segment elevation in 2 or more of V1-3 followed by a negative T wave. This is classical of Brugada type 1 syndrome and is commonly known as the Brugada sign.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial and characterised by progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Presentation is normal with worsening biventricular failure including peripheral and pulmonary oedema. Syncope episodes are rare and symptoms are not fluctuant, as seen in this patient. ECG abnormalities are those associated with atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with conduction delays (e.g. LBBB), left axis deviation and poor R wave progression.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), is a result of a genetic defect affecting the desmosomes of the myocardium. ARVD results in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, mainly affecting the right ventricle. The condition leads to hypokinetic areas of the ventricle wall and myocardium fibrofatty replacement with which results in associated arrhythmias. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncope, and potentially sudden cardiac death however ECG findings are of T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3 and of right bundle branch block which are not present in this case.\n\nWellen's syndrome is the ECG pattern of biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in the chest leads V2-3. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and therefore is normally seen in patients presenting with ischaemic-like symptoms."

This combination of symptoms is however only found in less than 20% of cases. As PE is a potentially life-threatening condition it is important to be aware of the wide variety of symptoms and signs that may accompany cases.\n\nA lot of patients who develop a PE have risk factors. There is one present in this case - combined oral contraceptive pill use. Tachycardia is also a common sign.\n\nIt would be unusual to develop an asthma attack with no previous history of asthma. Occasional wheezes are a relatively common finding in patients following a pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe ECG shows a sinus tachycardia and a partial S1Q3T3 - the S wave is not particularly convincing.\n\nDiscuss (5)Improve"

On review today her clinic BP appears to be well controlled at 132/84mmHg and her bloods show her creatinine has risen to 125umol/L.

A hospitalacquired pneumonia would usually take longer to develop. A coronary artery dissection can be a complication of PCI but there would most likely be ischaemic changes seen on the ECG. Pleurisy is usually a post inflammatory condition after a lower respiratory tract infection. Pulmonary embolism is possible but patients with MI are anticoagulated and this is early for a PE to develop. It is recognised that a number of MI patients develop and acute pericarditis in the first 48hrs. Treatment is supportive and it is key to rule out other complications first."

    "block": "## Question #244\n\nA 76-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath on exertion, difficulty walking up stairs, and significant weight gain over the last 2 weeks. His daughter who is with him expresses concerns about him and says that he is needing to lay upright in his armchair in order to get any sleep.\n\nHis medical history includes 2 previous non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions for which he was treated with coronary stenting and hypertension. Physical examination shows a heart rate of 111 beats per minute and blood pressure of 113/76 mmHg. He is visibly short of breath at rest and is using accessory muscles. His JVP is 7cm above the angle of Louis, his apical impulse is laterally displaced, and heart sounds are audible with a holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex. Auscultation of his chest reveals audible crepitations bibasally and he has 2+ peripheral oedema extending to his mid-thighs. An ECG shows Q-waves in his inferior leads, and his bloods show elevated troponins.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\n\n- f) Obtain an urgent echocardiogram\n- g) Prescribe oral furosemide and discharge from the emergency department with a view to follow up with his GP\n- h) Load him with aspirin and clopidogrel\n- i) Commence bisoprolol to control his heart rat\n- j) Administer a bolus of intravenous furosemide and then start him on an infusion\n\n## Correct answer is e.\n\nThe most appropriate medication in patients with acute heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who have signs of volume overload is addition/uptitration of a loop diuretic\n\nThis patient presents with acute decompensated congestive heart failure. He has evidence of significant volume overload on exam, with an elevated JVP and signs of pulmonary and peripheral oedema. The aetiology of his heart failure is likely to be ischaemic cardiomyopathy related to his history of myocardial infarctions and manifests with a displaced apical impulse and a holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apical region, suggestive of significant ventricular dilatation. His symptoms are severe and he requires inpatient hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous loop diuretics to improve his symptoms and to optimise his volume status.\n\nAn echocardiogram would be useful in the evaluation of this patient but is not the most appropriate next step as he is currently significantly symptomatic and needs intravenous loop diuretics to improve his volume status.\n\nAlthough this patient does need to be treated with loop diuretics, he is in significant distress and likely needs to be admitted as an inpatient and should be treated more aggressively with intravenous loop diuretics.\n\nThis patient does have a history of ischaemic heart disease and is at risk of having further ischemic events. However, the findings on his ECG represent an old inferior infarct, and there a no features to suggest an acute event. In addition, he may have elevated troponins simply as a result of having ischaemic cardiomyopathy. He does not necessarily need to be loaded on dual antiplatelet therapy at this moment, but he should have his troponins trended to ensure there is no significant rise in their values.\n\nStarting a beta-blocker in acute decompensated heart failure is contraindicated"

In addition, she has a number of minor criteria, including fever, vascular events (stroke), immunological events (splinter haemorrhages, renal impairment secondary to glomerulonephritis). Despite starting on appropriate empirical treatment she appears to have an ongoing infection from her blood tests, and her ECG demonstrates a prolonged PR interval which may be reflective of an enlarging aortic abscess disrupting the atrioventricular node, which is an indication for referral for cardiothoracic surgery in infective endocarditis.\n\n## Other surgical indications include\n\n- \uf0b7 Heart failure: valve obstruction resulting in pulmonary oedema or shock, severe acute regurgitation\n- \uf0b7 Uncontrolled infection: abscess, false aneurysm, persisting fever and positive blood cultures for greater than 10 days despite appropriate antibiotics, multiresistant microorganisms\n- \uf0b7 Prevention of embolism: large vegetations resulting in one or more embolic episodes despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, or other predictors of complications eg. heart failure.\n\nShe has a penicillin-resistant streptococci, according to the British Society of\n\nAntimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines, should be treated with vancomycin and gentamicin, so options (a) and (c) are incorrect. Streptococcus Bovis bacteraemia is associated with bowel malignancy, and a colonoscopy should be arranged to rule out malignancy, however, the worsening PR prolongation takes priority and should be managed first.\n\nAn urgent trans-oesophageal echocardiogram may be useful to evaluate the size of the aortic abscess, however, it would not change management as this patient needs to be referred to the cardiothoracic surgeons as there is already evidence of enlarging vegetation."

He returned from a business trip to Thailand six months ago, during which he consumed more alcohol than he usually does. He takes no medications and is otherwise fit and well, and is a non-smoker. On examination there is mild pedal oedema, his chest is clear and jugular venous pressure(JVP) is raised on inspiration. Auscultation of his heart reveals an extra heart sound very soon after S2.\n\nWhat is the likely cause of his symptoms?\n\n- f) Superior vena cava obstruction\n- g) Cardiac tamponade\n- h) Left ventricular failure\n- i) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n- j) Constrictive pericarditis\n\n## Correct answer is e.\n\nExamination of this patient demonstrates Kussmaul's sign - paradoxical elevation of the JVP on inspiration. This sign is seen in constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade and restrictive cardiomyopathy. This presentation gives no other features to suggest tamponade. His constrictive pericarditis here is likely cause by the previous radiotherapy for lymphoma. Other causes of constrictive pericarditis include TB and chronic pericarditis.

There are no 'step-ups' in oxygen saturations, demonstrating no shunts. However, you will note that the pulmonary arterial pressure is greater than the normal one-fifth of systolic measurements; hence pulmonary hypertension is present. In addition, there is a greater than 25mmHg gradient across the aorta valve, demonstrating moderate aortic stenosis. Lastly, the capillary wedge pressure is equivalent to the left atrial pressure, which should also be the same as the left ventricular diastolic pressure. A normal mitral valve expects less than 5mmHg pressure difference. Using these inferences, the mitral valve gradient is calculated by the capillary wedge pressure of 20mmHg (same as the left atrial pressure) minus the diastolic left ventricular pressure of 11mmHg: the 9mmHg difference thus also demonstrates mitral stenosis."

She had been diagnosed by the emergency department doctors as having community acquired pneumonia after seeing consolidation on her chest Xray and sepsis secondary to this with associated delirium. Collateral history from her partner establishes that she had been feeling unwell for two days with a cough and become increasingly unwell, confused and agitated. The partner also explained that she had recently been diagnosed with an overactive thyroid and been told to start urgently on anti-thyroid tablets, but had not done so when she had read the label of these tablets and found that they should not be taken during pregnancy and she is trying to become pregnant. She had been taking paracetamol only for fever.\n\nDespite treating with IV co-amoxiclav and oral clarithromycin and fluid resuscitation with three liters of fluid as well as IV paracetamol the patient has not improved.\n\nOn examination she is very agitated and aggressive and is difficult to examine. She feels very hot and clammy to touch, but peripheries are well perfused.\n\nAuscultation shows left sided crepitations. Her heart rate is 170 bpm, blood pressure 81/40 mmHg, temperature 39.2\u00baC, oxygen saturations 100% on 2L via nasal cannulae.\n\nBlood tests from this admission are still pending. Out-patient blood tests show a undetectable low TSH two weeks ago, as well as a free T4 of 53mmol/ml.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate immediate treatment?\n\n- a. Change to IV meropenem and monitor\n- b. Start carbimazole\n- c. Urgent referral for thyroidectomy\n- d. Start IV propranolol\n- e. IV adenosine\n\nAnswer is D.\n\nIn thyroid storm with IV beta-blockers are a important first-line treatment\n\nThis is a patient with severe confusion, fever and evidence of chest infection and untreated hyperthyroidism. The clinical history suggests that she has developed a thyroid storm as she has fever, severe tachycardia, confusion and agitation with hyperthyroidism. This is a medical emergency, and the most urgent matter is to control her heart rate which is likely the cause for her low blood pressure. IV beta-blocker should be started for this purpose, and propranolol would further help reduce the conversion of T3 into T4. In addition, fluids and dexamethasone should be given, as well as anti-thyroid medications.\n\nChanging to meropenem is unlikely to add any further benefit as the effects of the co-amoxiclav probably have not been seen yet. As the patient is not stable it is not appropriate to refer for surgery as management, but may be a viable longterm strategy to treat her hyperthyroidism. Starting carbimazole now is not the most appropriate action as the patient is unstable and this needs to be corrected first. Adenosine is would be appropriate for a patient with SVT without infection and thyrotoxicosis"

Serum cortisol of 220 mmol/l at 9am after an overnight dexamethasone suppression test\n- d. Serum potassium of 2.4 mmol/l\n- e. Undetectable levels of ACTH6\n\nThe answer is E.\n\nThe key fact is that an adrenal adenoma producing cortisol would suppress the release of ACTH. For this reason, if ACTH is undetectable then an adrenal tumour is the most likely cause. In this case, a CT abdomen would be the obvious next step.\n\nNormal 9 am serum cortisol would make a diagnosis of Cushing's less likely, and a raised urinary free cortisol on repeat testing is not specific for the underlying cause. Failure to suppress after overnight dexamethasone suppression test merely confirms a diagnosis of Cushing's. Serum potassium levels as low as 2.4 mmol/l would be very unusual in a case of Cushing's."

His diabetes is currently controlled with a combination of diet and metformin 500mg tds. Looking at his records the last HbA1c was 6.4% (46 mmol/mol). If he decides to fast during Ramadan, what is the most appropriate advice to give regarding his metformin?\n\n- a) Metformin should be stopped\n- b) Metformin 1.5g after sunset\n- c) Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset\n- d) Metformin 500mg after sunset\n- e) Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset\n\nDuring Ramadan, one-third of the normal metformin dose should be taken before sunrise and two-thirds should be taken after sunset\n\nThe correct answer is Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset . This is because during Ramadan, individuals who fast are required to refrain from consuming food and drink from sunrise to sunset. In order to maintain adequate glycaemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia, it is recommended that metformin be taken in a divided dose - a smaller dose before sunrise (predawn meal or Suhoor) and a larger dose after sunset (evening meal or Iftar). This allows for better distribution of the medication throughout the day while still adhering to the fasting requirements.\n\nMetformin should be stopped is incorrect because stopping metformin abruptly may result in poor glycaemic control and increased risk of hyperglycaemia. It is important for patients with diabetes to continue their medications during Ramadan, with appropriate adjustments made under medical supervision.\n\nMetformin 1.5g after sunset is not the best option because taking the entire daily dose at once can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and may not provide optimal glycaemic control throughout the day. Dividing the dose as mentioned earlier helps maintain better blood glucose levels during fasting hours.\n\nMetformin 500mg after sunset is also incorrect because this dosing regimen significantly reduces the total daily dose of metformin compared to his current regimen, which may lead to inadequate glycaemic control. Additionally, it does not account for any pre-dawn medication intake.\n\nFinally, Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset is not ideal as it provides a higher dose before sunrise than necessary. The recommended approach is to take a smaller dose before sunrise and a larger one after sunset in order to minimize potential hypoglycaemia during fasting hours while maintaining adequate glycaemic control"

This, in combination with the absence of GI symptoms, should alert you to the possibility of underlying renal tubular acidosis.\n\nFanconi syndrome is a disorder of proximal renal tubular function that leads to abnormal loss of bicarbonate, glucose, potassium, phosphate, uric acid and amino acids in the urine. Patients have features of type 2 renal tubular acidosis, accompanied by hypophosphataemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Presenting features include polyuria, polydipsia, osteomalacia (rickets and growth failure in children) and symptoms secondary to the electrolyte abnormalities associated with the disorder. Rifampicin has recently been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and is the most likely cause in this case.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome are causes of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis; a failure of hydrogen ion secretion in the distal tubule that causes hypokalaemia and nephrocalcinosis. The absence of abnormal renal calcification on the patient's x-ray points away from this as the diagnosis.\n\nAddison's disease typically causes hyperkalaemia, often associated with other electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia and hypoglycaemia. It would, therefore, be inconsistent with the biochemistry provided.\n\nLiver cirrhosis does not typically cause renal tubular acidosis unless it is itself a manifestation of Wilson's disease. There is nothing in the question to suggest Wilson's disease as the underlying diagnosis, however, and the occurrence of this pattern of metabolic abnormality would still be predicated on the development of a complicating Fanconi syndrome"

He has signed up for a marathon and is wondering what to do with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for the event. He is normally fit and well without any other medical problems. His diagnosis was established five years ago and since then he has had two admissions due to an inability of taking hydrocortisone and now has emergency doses of IM hydrocortisone. What is the most appropriate advice to give?\n\n- a) Take doses as normal for the marathon\n- b) Double the hydrocortisone dose but not the fludrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- c) Double the fludrocortisone dose but not hydrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- d) Double both the fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose for the marathon\n- e) Omit both medications for the marathon Answer is B.\n\nA patient with Addisons' disease who undertakes significantly strenuous activity should double the dose of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoids\n\nThis is a patient with Addison's disease who is planning significantly strenuous activity. In such a situation, both fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose should be doubled, with advice to increase fluid intake as well. If the patient was just on hydrocortisone then no additional fludrocortisone would be needed.\n\nGlucocorticoid therapy should ideally mimic endogenous cortisol rhythm with the lowest level at time of falling asleep and highest at waking. Treatment should aim to control symptoms at the smallest dose possible. Hydrocortisone has a short half-life but excellent bioavailibility.\n\nMineralocorticoid therapy will be eventually required in adrenal insufficiency to counter intravascular volume depletion. It is important in the presence of increased fluid loss that the mineralocorticoid dose is adjusted. This is why doubling of the dose is advised.\n\nIf less strenuous activity, such as a long hike, was planned than increasing the dose of hydrocortisone by 5-10mg would be reasonable, without any change in fludrocortisone. This change would also apply for any day that increased activity is planned for. They should also be advised to increase fluid intake in the proportion to the increase in hydrocortisone dose.\n\nIf a patient is taking an alternative steroid regime, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, then endocrinology advise would be needed.\n\nOmitting any medications could be dangerous and precipitate an Addisonian crisis."

Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome display clinical and biochemical features similar to those seen in Cushing's syndrome, such as the scenario here, but the presentation is caused by alcohol abuse, rather than an endogenous source or steroid use. Other causes of pseudoCushing's include severe depression, eating disorders, and chronic illness. Of the options listed above, the insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.\n\nThe high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic sources of Cushing's syndrome.

Her history includes two previous attacks of renal calculi formation managed conservatively. She had a car crash recently, where she says that the car just 'came out of nowhere'. She is intermittently getting global headaches that can be very severe in nature but are otherwise featureless. On prompting, she tells you that she has sometimes noticed a white nipple discharge on her clothing. She has had low blood pressure and several faints over this last year and after her GP discovered a low serum cortisol level he has started her on oral hydrocortisone and referred her to your clinic. On examination today her blood pressure 130/80. She has a blistering, red rash across her lower abdomen and back. Her abdomen is largely non-tender with no palpable organomegally or peritonism. Visual fields are reduced bitemporally. Her urine dipstick shows glycosuria. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is likely to treat the underlying condition most effectively?\n\n- a) Bisphosphonates\n- b) Surgery\n- c) Cabergoline\n- d) Octreotide\n- e) Insulin\n\nThe unifying diagnosis here is is multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas.\n\nThis patient has symptoms of hypercalcaemia (abdominal groans, renal stones, and psychic moans of the 'bones, stones, groans, psychic moans'). This can be caused by a parathyroid tumour. She has symptoms suggestive of a nonfunctioning pituitary macro-adenoma causing hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea and galactorrhoea) and hypopituitarism presenting as Addison's from suppressed ACTH. Dopamine is the inhibitor of prolactin in the pituitary, and comes from the hypothalamus. A nonfunctioning pituitary macro-adenoma compresses the pituitary stalk, interrupting dopamine flow to the pituitary, and therefore abolishing dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin, resulting in hyperprolactinaemia.\n\nAt the same time, the macro-adenoma causes hypopituitarism through local pressure effects on the pituitary itself. 76% of pituitary tumours in MEN1 are prolactinomas, with the remainder being nonfunctioning adenomas. Prolactinomas are extremely sensitive to medical management with e.g. cabergoline or bromocriptine and even shrink in size subsequently. First line treatment for nonfunctioning adenomas however is surgical removal. The gylcosuria is suggestive of hyperglycaemia, which in the context of this MEN picture suggests a glucagonoma.\n\nThe answers try and trick you into looking to manage just one of the abnormalities here in an isolated fashion, e.g. targeting the pituitary with cabergoline, the pancreas with insulin, or the parathyroid with bisphosphonates. This may may happen if you do not recognise that this is MEN. However, as the question asks what treatment is likely to treat the underlying condition, clearly insulin alone, cabergoline alone, or bisphosphonate alone will not suffice. Of the options available, only surgery can tackle all of the problems, and indeed is what most patients with MEN end up needing.\n\nMEN is an autosomal dominant condition. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, anterior pituitary, and pancreas:\n\n- \uf0b7 The parathyroid tumours cause hypercalcaemia and its symptoms (which don't forget include polyuria and polydypsia). The management of hypercalcaemia is fluid resuscitation and bisphosphonates.\n- \uf0b7 Pituitary tumours can be a prolactinoma, somatotroph adenoma (causing acromegally by secreting growth hormone), or an ACTH-secreting tumour causing Cushing's disease. There can be any combination of these, although the question will usually point you toward one particular pituitary abnormality. Remember that you are unlikely to elicit a galactorrhoea history unless you specifically ask and are sensitive about it.\n- \uf0b7 The pancreas tumours can be an insulinoma (persistent hypoglycaemia -check C-peptide which will be high in endogenous insulin secretion as opposed to exogenously given insulin e.g. in self harm/non-accidental injury, where c-peptide levels remain low. ), gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison, presenting as refractory gastric ulcers), glucagonoma causing persistent hyperglycaemia and also a necrolytic migratory erythema (as in this case), or a VIPoma causing profuse watery diarrhoea (VIP is the antagonist to gastrin and therefore tries to get you to flush the gut out rather than hold and digest contents.\n\nMEN II has two forms. MEN2a presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma (neck lump), parathyroid tumour (hypercalcemia) and pheochromocytoma (hypertension, flushing, tachycardia intermittently). MEN2b presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.\n\nThe key message for the exam is that if you are presented with a case where you suspect there is an endocrine abnormality (even just a high calcium), look again at the stem to make sure you are not missing other endocrine abnormalities being present (e.g. amenorrhoea) that might alert you to there being an underlying diagnosis of MEN. If you know a few key features of each of the possible abnormalities within each type of MEN, you should be able to pinpoint which MEN type is present."

Hypotonic saline (0.45%)\n\n## If SIADH is resistant to fluid restriction then the drug demeclocycline can be used\n\nThe differential for hyponatraemia is wide. The fluid status of the patient is of paramount importance for identifying the cause. In this example, the patient is clearly euvolaemic. Causes of euvolaemic hyponatraemia include SIADH, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. The serum and urine osmolarities, and urinary sodium are consistent with either of these diagnoses.\n\nSIADH is effectively a diagnosis of exclusion - primary hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism must be excluded to make the diagnosis.\n\nIn this case, the thyroid function tests are suggestive of euthyroid sick syndrome. This would not be an indication for initiating levothyroxine. Although hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of hyponatraemia euthyroid sick syndrome would not effect sodium balance. It is often stated that to make a diagnosis of SIADH relies upon 'normal thyroid function tests'. It is important to note that this is referring to primary hypothyroidism. Euthyroid sick syndrome does not preclude the diagnosis of SIADH.\n\nThe morning cortisol is normal which suggests that hypoadrenalism is not present.\n\nTherefore the most likely diagnosis is SIADH secondary to a chest infection. The initial treatment for non-severe SIADH is fluid restriction.\n\nThis patient has been trialled with fluid restriction however the sodium has not improved and has in fact got worse. The next step in the management would be demeclocycline. Demeclocycline inhibits the effects of ADH on the renal tubules. It effectively causes a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant use of hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline has risks associated with it, as rapid correction of serum Na can result in central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nIf the patient had been hypervolaemic then furosemide would be indicated"

He usually takes metformin 500 mg three times daily, gliclazide 80 mg twice daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg nightly.\n\nOn examination he is confused with dry mucous membranes, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, a pulse of 110/min, a temperature of 37.6 oC and a respiratory rate of 20/min. Course crepitations were found at the right base and his pulse was thready with a capillary refill of 3 seconds; jugular venous pressure was not visible. Capillary blood glucose was found to be HI.\n\n## A venous blood sample is taken:\n\n| Hb         | 129 g/l        | Na +       | 161 mmol/l   |\n|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Platelet s | 204 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 4.9 mmol/l   |\n| WBC        | 13.1 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 15.2 mmol/l  |\n| Neuts      | 11.9 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine | 97 \u00b5mol/l    |\n| Glucose    | 56 mmol/l      | eGFR       | 62 mg/l      |\n| Ketones    | 1.9 mmol/l     | HbA1c      | 75 mmol/mol  |\n| pH         | 7.35           | HCO3       | 20 mmol/mol  |\n\n## What treatment would you initiate first?\n\n- a. 0.9% normal saline\n- b. 0.45 % normal saline\n- c. Hartmann's solution\n- d. Intravenous insulin\n- e. 5% dextrose\n\n## Answer is A.\n\nThe underlying diagnosis is hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) precipitated by a lower respiratory tract infection. The diagnosis is made when a patient shows marked hyperglycaemia and hypovolaemia with a serum osmolality &gt; 320 mosm/kg in the absence of marked ketonaemia or acidosis. This patient is clinically dry with a glucose of 56 and a calculated osmolality of 2(161+4.9) + 56 +\n\n## 15 = 403 mosm/kg with mild ketonaemia.\n\nDespite this gentlemen's hypernatraemia, the first line fluid therapy is 0.9% normal saline as patients in HHS are sodium deplete. One litre should be administered rapidly and electrolytes then repeated to gauge potassium requirements in further fluid bags. A small initial rise in sodium is expected and this should not discourage further use of normal saline. Insulin is not routinely started immediately in the absence of significant ketonaemia as glucose will fall with fluid therapy alone. When glucose stops falling insulin may be started if glucose still remains high. Too rapid correction of osmolality i.e. with aggressive insulin and fluids in combination can precipitate cerebral oedema."

Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The biochemical profile is in keeping with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to the presence of low testosterone and inappropriately normal LH and FSH. Kallmann's syndrome is the only listed condition which results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is correct. Androgen insensitivity syndrome in its complete form is a disorder of hormone resistance characterised by a female phenotype in a genetic male due to the resistance to the effector functions of testosterone. The hormonal profile findings include very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH. Thus the patient's phenotypical sex and hormonal profile exclude this diagnosis.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is incorrect. Klinefelter syndrome is an aneuploid genetic condition where a male has an additional copy of the X chromosome. The primary features are infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles. This condition results in primary gonadal failure, and thus a compensatory elevation in LH and FSH.\n\nMullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Given that the patient is phenotypically male, this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\nTurner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. This would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels. It only affects females. Thus the patient's phenotypic sex, and biochemical results are not in keeping with this diagnosis."

It is important to note that 'Less than half of the patients with BBB and syncope have a final diagnosis of cardiac syncope, albeit the probability is different among different type of BBB'. Given his symptomatology and the examination findings alongside the 72-hour holter monitor this is unlikely to be purely cardiogenic therefore further investigation is needed. With his age and presentation, autonomic dysfunction could be the cause, therefore carotid sinus and tilt-test may provide the answer. An MRI head and an EEG remain plausible options, but given the lack of solid seizure-like activity, can be arranged later on, provided that no answer is given by other tests.\n\nDiscuss (9)Improve"

The patient had been diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis 4 months previously, after experiencing progressive exertional breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance. At her initial review at cardiology clinic, the patient had expressed interest in undergoing intervention for aortic stenosis: either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve insertion (TAVI). Subsequently, the patient had undergone a variety of investigations to assess her suitability for the above procedures.\n\nThe patient had a good functional status, leaving independently with her daughter and still participating in a wide range of community activities. The patient had a long-standing diagnosis of hypertension and had suffered a left cortical stroke 3 years previously. In addition, the patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although she had stopped smoking 30 years previously.

Given the patient's age, if she was to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) then a bioprosthetic valve would be preferred over a mechanical valve, freeing the patient from the need for lifelong anticoagulation. Typical risk stratification for SAVR defines the estimated risk of peri-operative death as low (&lt; 4 %), intermediate (4-8 %) and high (&gt; 8 %). Due to her comorbidities, the patient has an intermediate risk associated with SAVR, calculated using the STS risk calculator (http://riskcalc.sts.org/stswebriskcalc/#/).\n\nTranscatheter aortic valve insertion (TAVI) was initially developed for patients considered unfit for SAVR due to high predicted mortality. However, a recent randomised controlled trial comparing outcomes for TAVI versus SAVR as an intervention for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis has demonstrated that transfemoral TAVI can be a suitable intervention for some patients with a low or intermediate risk associated with SAVR. Transfemoral TAVI is increasingly favoured over SAVR as patient age increases.\n\nIn contrast, outcomes for transapical TAVI are inferior to SAVR, so this intervention is only appropriate for individuals with an unacceptably high surgical risk. For patients where both SAVR and transapical TAVI are possible, SAVR is str ongly favoured at all patient ages.\n\nTherefore, for this patient, bioprosthetic SAVR is the intervention of choice, favoured over transapical TAVI. Transfemoral TAVI is technically impossible in this patient due to the anatomy of her iliac arteries."

During the generation of the action potential in cardiac pacemaker cells, phase 4 (inflow of potassium) is dependant on magnesium channels, and, although the exact effect in vivo of magnesium administration is unclear, restoring normomagnesaemia is important in patient presenting with dysrhythmias.\n\nPPI use is associated with hypomagnesaemia - the exact mechanism of this is not known, but may be related to poorer intestinal absorption from dietary sources in patients on PPIs."

    "block": "## Question #282\n\nA 38-year-old female of Asian descent, with no significant past medical history, presents after a syncopal event while pruning hedges. She has had a 6-month history of fever, arthralgia and for the past few weeks has had multiple episodes of vertigo and one syncopal event. She denies headaches or visual complaints. Her examination reveals a diminished radial pulse in the left arm and a systolic blood pressure difference in the upper extremities of 14 mmHg. A bruit is auscultated along the left upper extremity. Dopplers of the upper extremities indicate a stenotic area along the subclavian that is later confirmed by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). She is diagnosed with subclavian steal syndrome. Laboratory tests reveal a normocytic normochromic anaemia, elevated CRP and ESR, negative ANA and ANCA, and all other laboratory tests are within normal range. Of the following, What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n- f) Fibromuscular dysplasia\n- g) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n- h) Takayasu arteritis\n- i) Giant cell arteritis\n- j) Wegener's granulomatosis\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nThis patient likely has Takayasu arteritis which is essentially a chronic vasculitis primarily of the aorta and its branches. These patients can present in a variety of different ways depending on the vessels affected, however, they all typically have a prodrome of systemic symptoms including fatigue, weight loss and low-grade fevers prior to developing any vascular complaints. From a pathology standpoint biopsies of vessels are very similar to giant cell and are typically not performed.\n\nThere are 6 criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu. Presence of 3 of the 6 has 90% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis:\n\n- \uf0b7 1. Age onset &lt;=40 years\n- \uf0b7 2. Claudication of the extremities\n- \uf0b7 3. Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries\n- \uf0b7 4. Difference of at least 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure between the arms\n- \uf0b7 5. Bruit over one or both subclavian arteries or the abdominal aorta\n- \uf0b7 6. Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or other causes\n\nFibromuscular dysplasia typically affects the renal arteries leading to renal artery stenosis and hypertension, and it not accompanied by other systemic manifestations like fever and malaise. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic defect in type III collagen and can lead to aneurysms along with hyperelasticity of the skin and hypermobile joints, but other systemic manifestations are typically not present. Giant cell arteritis is most similar to Takayasu in pathology, however typically affects older patients and usually presents with headaches and tenderness over the temporal artery. Lastly, Wegener's is actually a small vessel vasculitis and its most common presenting symptoms include persistent rhinorrhoea, purulent/bloody nasal discharge, oral and/or nasal ulcers, polyarthralgias, myalgias, or sinus pain. Most with Wegener's are ANCA positive."

You also review his bloods:\n\nHb\n\n128 g/L\n\nMale: (135-180)\n\n|            |               | Female: (115 - 160)   |\n|------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Platelets  | 335 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)           |\n| WBC        | 6.8 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)          |\n| Na +       | 136 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)           |\n| K +        | 4.7 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)           |\n| Urea       | 6.8 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)           |\n| Creatinine | 126 \u00b5mol/L    | (55 - 120)            |\n\nHe is currently on carvedilol 25 mg BD, enalapril 10 mg BD, bumetanide 2 mg BD, aspirin 75 mg, ivabradine 2.5 mg BD.\n\nWhat alteration to this gentleman's management could potentially decrease this gentleman's probability of being re-admitted?\n\n- f) Arrange cardiac resynchronisation therapy-pacemaker (CRT-P) implantation\n- g) Increase ivabradine\n- h) Increase bumetanide\n- i) Increase spironolactone\n- j) Initiate sacubitril/valsartan\n\n## Correct answer is a.\n\nCardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used in patients with a QRS duration of &gt;130 msec and LBBB morphology to improve symptomatology\n\nThe European society of cardiology (ESC) guidelines have highlighted the importance of cardiac resynchronisation in patients with heart failure. Evidence exists indicating the importance of implantation of such devices in patients with intraventricular delay with most studies focusing on the impact of left bundle branch block. The stronger evidence related CRT-P in such patients include left bundle branch block (LBBB) and QRS &gt;150 msec; however the presence of LBBB on its own provided that the QRS is longer than 120 msec is associated with improved mortality/morbidity. There is no evidence of benefit from CRT for patients with QRS &lt;120 msec, while the presence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) implies a worse disease state where CRT may not necessarily benefit such patients.\n\nThe possibility of altering medications in this case remains attractive however one should be aware of the potential of introducing detriment to the patient in doing so.\n\nThis patient is already tolerating a relatively slow heart rate therefore ivabradine could potentially cause further slowing.\n\nHe is borderline hypotensive with raised potassium (making the possibility of increasing spironolactone less favourable."

A routine blood pressure check revealed a blood pressure of 158/98 mmHg. Other than suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, her pregnancy had proceeded without complication. She specifically denied the presence of headaches, vomiting, change in vision, abdominal pain, seizures or bleeding per vagina. She had noticed no change in the frequency of foetal movements, and her 20-week antenatal scan revealed the presence of a healthy foetus with a rate of growth within the expected range. Her past medical history was unremarkable; she was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. Her blood pressure at the booking antenatal appointment was 148/88 mmHg. Her sister suffered from preeclampsia during her pregnancy necessitating delivery by caesarean section.\n\nExamination revealed the presence of a well 28-week old pregnant lady. Her blood pressure was indeed 158/98 mmHg, her heart rate was 86 bpm and temperature 36.5\u00baC. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed normal heart sounds, a JVP of 3cm and the absence of pedal oedema. Examination of the respiratory system was unremarkable. Examination of the gastrointestinal system revealed the presence of a symphysiofundal height appropriate for the stage of gestation with easily obtainable foetal heart sounds on hand held Doppler examination. Examination of the neurological system was unremarkable with normal reflexes, cranial nerve function and peripheral motor and sensory function. Urinalysis revealed no abnormality.\n\nWhat is the next best management step?\n\n- f) Commence ramipril\n- g) Commence labetalol\n- h) Commence indapamide\n- i) Commence magnesium sulphate\n- j) Transfer to high dependency unit to observe for signs of pre eclampsia\n\n## Correct answer is b.\n\nThis lady has pre-existing hypertension; her blood pressure at the antenatal booking clinic was elevated and continues to be elevated throughout (as opposed to gestational hypertension in which hypertension develops after 20 weeks). If untreated hypertension is associated with adverse maternal and foetal outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, cerebrovascular accidents and prematurity. There are no clinical features of preeclampsia, including notably the presence of proteinuria and peripheral oedema, and there is, therefore, no indication for admission to a high dependency unit or to commence magnesium sulphate. Of the remaining options, labetalol is the safest antihypertensive to use in pregnancy; methyldopa is an alternative. The usual first line ACE inhibitors are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy."

The high troponin results indicate myocardial injury which in this case can be attributed to myopericarditis. Troponin is a marker of myocardial injury which can result due to primary ischaemia (plaque rupture or intraluminal coronary artery thrombus), ischaemia secondary to misbalance of supply and demand (tachy/bradyarrhythmias, aortic dissection or severe aortic valve disease, sepsis, severe anaemia or respiratory failure etc.) and myocardial injury not necessarily associated to ischaemia or multifactorial (such as myopericarditis, severe pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, cardiac stunning, cardiac surgery or intervention etc.) There is no strong, dynamic rise in the already high troponin level.\n\nThe fact that he is a smoker undeniably puts this gentleman at a higher risk of coronary event, however his blood tests, ECG and history point further to the direction of pericarditis. Given this, options 1, 2 and 3 which are associated with the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are wrong.\n\nThe current guidelines as per the European Society of cardiology state that the treatment of choice in such patients is a combination of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen) and colchicine (option 5) and do not advocate the use of a single agent, such as ibuprofen (option 4)."

She states that she has had a few episodes similar to this in the past and each time they have spontaneously resolved. On examination she has a blood pressure of 85/65 mmHg and a heart rate of 180bpm. An ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, no identifiable P waves, and a QRS of 135ms.\n\nYour senior decides to electrically cardiovert her. While the cardioversion is being prepared you instruct the patient to perform a vagal manoeuvre. Shortly after this she loses consciousness and goes into cardiac arrest.\n\nWhat is the most likely underlying disorder?\n\n- f) Torsades de Pointes\n- g) Atrial fibrillation\n- h) Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)\n- i) Monomorphic ventricular tachycardi\n- j) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nAV blocking drugs and vagal manoeuvres are absolutely contraindicated in patients with AF and pre-excitation\n\nThere are few arrhythmias, which can cause an irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia. These include irregular atrial arrhythmias with bundle branch block (e.g. atrial fibrillation), and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (including Torsades de Pointes). Another important group of conditions to be aware of include the pre-excitation syndromes.\n\nPre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an accessory pathway. This results in a broad QRS complex e.g. the slurred upstroke of QRS (delta wave) as is seen in WPW. When present with atrial fibrillation, the accessory pathway allows for rapid conduction directly to the ventricles bypassing the AV node. This results in an irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia.\n\nThe Valsalva manoeuvre increases the vagal tone resulting in AV node block. This promotes conduction of the atrial signals through the accessory pathway with a resultant increase in ventricular rate and possible degeneration into VT or VF, as is seen in this case.\n\nAV blocking drugs and vagal manoeuvres are absolutely contraindicated in patients with AF and pre-excitation. In a haemodynamically unstable patient, urgent synchronised DC cardioversion is required. Medical treatment options in a stable patient include procainamide, although DC cardioversion may be preferred. Procainamide is a class 1 anti-arrhythmic which preferentially blocks the accessory pathway."

She takes metformin, sertraline and furosemide.\n\nOn examination, she looks unwell. She has bilateral crepitations with no wheeze on auscultation of her chest, a raised JVP, and a systolic murmur. A chest X-ray shows pulmonary oedema. She is treated with IV diuretics but remains breathless and hypoxic. What kind of ventilatory support would be most appropriate?\n\n- f) No ventilator support is appropriate\n- g) Negative pressure ventilation\n- h) Intubation\n- i) Bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP)\n- j) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\nCorrect answer is e.\n\nAcute heart failure not responding to treatment - consider CPAP\n\nThe correct answer is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This is a patient with a known mitral valve prolapse presenting with decompensation. It can be assumed that the lesion is significant as she is due to have surgery to repair it. She has developed signs of pulmonary oedema and she is not responding to treatment with diuretics.

BIPAP would be appropriate in ventilatory failure in COPD, whilst negative pressure ventilation is more of historical treatment for polio.\n\nMitral valve prolapse has a prevalence of 2-3% in the population and the majority of cases will be asymptomatic. Risk factors for progression the severe disease include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Comorbidities: atrial fibrillation, left sided cardiac failure, hypertension and obesity.\n- \uf0b7 Echocardiogram findings: mitral leaflet thickness &gt;5mm, prolapse of the posterior leaflet, moderate or severe regurgitation.\n- \uf0b7 Stress echocardiogram findings: regurgitation during exercise but not at rest."

Electrical alternans occurs due to the movement or 'swinging' of the heart within the pericardium as a result of the fluid present. This results in a variable amplitude of the QRS complex depending on the hearts proximity to the ECG leads. In this case, this was likely precipitated by a traumatic removal of trans-venous pacing wires causing bleeding into the pericardial space. As a result, she requires an urgent echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis and subsequent pericardiocentesis or re-sternotomy to drain the blood. It is worth noting that her acute kidney injury is the result of poor cardiac output as a result of her tamponade.\n\nAlthough there are electrolyte abnormalities on this patient's blood tests that should be replaced, this is not likely to be the cause of her acute presentation. An arrhythmia post-operatively could cause a reduction in cardiac output however the ECG performed here demonstrates sinus rhythm and therefore electrolyte replacement would not reverse her current condition.\n\nAn acute coronary syndrome must be considered in cardiac post-operative patients complaining of chest pain however the electrical alternans on ECG with no remarkable ST changes to speak of is more consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Therefore, emergency percutaneous coronary intervention is not the most appropriate option here.\n\nA prolonged course of antibiotics may be employed if a diagnosis of infective endocarditis is suspected however this is not the case here for a variety of reasons. Firstly, infective endocarditis post-operatively is unlikely to present within 5 days. Furthermore, the electrical alternans on ECG is indicative of cardiac tamponade rather than infective endocarditis. Finally, although the patient has a fever and a raised CRP, these are common findings post-operatively due to the systemic inflammatory response to surgery and are not specific for infective endocarditis.\n\nArrhythmias are common in the post-operative period for patients who have undergone cardiac surgery, particularly valve surgery, however, this patient is in sinus rhythm at an acceptable rate. Therefore, as this patient's pathology is mechanical rather than electrical, urgent temporary pacing wire insertion will not help with her current issue.\n\nDiscuss (3)Improve"

In excess, TCAs can cause QT interval prolongation which can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. A polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia with a prolonged QT interval is characteristic of torsades de pointes.

The Sgarbossa criteria have therefore been developed to evaluate whether new LBBB represents an ACS. In this particular ECG there is more ST elevation than is normally expected with LBBB indicating a likely ACS."

This is a classical sign seen in the digoxin effect, the ECG changes that arise with digoxin within normal therapeutic levels. It is important to note that in digoxin toxicity, the most common dysrhythmias are supraventricular tachycardia with a slow ventricular response due to blocking of the AV node.\n\nWhilst calcium channel blockers can significantly disrupt the ECG, this is associated primarily with non-dihydropyridines such as verapamil or diltiazem, rather than dihydropyridines such as amlodipine which are less cardioselective.\n\nBisoprolol can give rise to bradycardia and PR prolongation on ECG but the ST changes observed here are consistent with the digoxin effect. Therefore, bisoprolol is incorrect.\n\nCitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and therefore can result in QT prolongation. The ST changes as described here are not consistent with this syndrome and therefore this is an incorrect answer.\n\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic that can result in hypokalemia and therefore flattened and inverted T waves. The ST segment in this ECG shows the classical 'scooped' appearance and therefore is more consistent with the digoxin effect rather than hypokalemia. Furosemide is therefore incorrect."

Over the last few months, he notices a crampy uncomfortable feeling in the back of both of his calves when he walks to the shops. The discomfort can be so bad that he has to stop and rest for a few minutes after which he notices that his symptoms are improved. On occasions, he also gets the symptoms when he is shopping in the supermarket. He attributes this to overexerting himself and tries to rest on his shopping trolley while walking but does not seem to help. He has a 40-pack year smoking history and takes amlodipine for his blood pressure, and paracetamol and ibuprofen for lower back pain that has troubled him for years.\n\nPhysical examination reveals mild atrophy of his thigh and calf muscles bilaterally, in addition to shiny pale skin with significant hair loss throughout his lower limbs.\n\nHis pedal pulses are bilaterally impalpable, and popliteal pulses are faint. Power in both lower limbs is normal throughout all movements, and he has normal patellar reflexes bilaterally and absent ankle reflexes. His Babinski reflex is downgoing on the left side and equivocal on the right side. A recently obtained ankle brachial pressure index test yielded a result of 0.70 on the right side and 0.95 on the left side. X-rays of his lumbar spine show evidence of joint space narrowing and osteophytes.\n\nWhich one of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?\n\n- f) MRI scan of lumbar spine\n- g) Check his HbA1c to screen for diabetes\n- h) Refer to vascular surgery for consideration of peripheral arterial stenting or bypass surgery\n- i) Starting him on duloxetine to manage his pain\n- j) Screen for coronary artery disease with ECG stress testing\n\nCorrect answer is c.\n\nIn patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms suggestive of claudication with an equivocal/borderline ankle brachial pressure index study result, the next best study is an ankle brachial pressure index after exercise\n\nThis gentleman has symptoms of claudication, in particular, vascular claudication. Although he does have a history of chronic back pain for which he takes analgesia, he is less likely to have neurogenic claudication compared to vascular claudication. An important discriminating factor between neurogenic claudication and vascular claudication is that patients with neurogenic claudication have symptoms on exertion that improve with manoeuvers such as leaning forward, and sitting down, whereas vascular claudication does not change with these manoeuvers and only improves with rest. In addition, his physical exam shows evidence of peripheral arterial disease characterised with muscle atrophy, shiny skin with hair loss and impalpable pedal pulses. Absent ankle jerk reflexes and equivocal Babinski reflexes can be normal variants and do not always indicate neurological pathology. This patient has rightly already undergone an ankle brachial pressure index assessment, and the results indicate a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. He is functionally impaired by his symptoms and so the next best step in his management would be to refer him to vascular surgery for consideration of treatment strategies which may include percutaneous interventions with stenting and/or surgical bypass.\n\nAlthough this patient has evidence of degenerative joint disease on his lumbar spine x-ray, his clinical presentation is not consistent with neurogenic claudication and so an MRI scan of his lumbar spine is not indicated.\n\nAlthough it is important to screen for and aggressively manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients with peripheral arterial disease, this in itself would not address the patient's symptoms or the disease course.\n\nThis patient's pain is most consistent with vascular claudication as opposed to neuropathic pain, for which an agent like duloxetine would be appropriate.\n\nAlthough individuals with peripheral arterial disease have a significant likelihood of having concomitant coronary disease, this patient is not complaining of angina or symptoms suggestive of coronary disease and so screening for this is not indicated. The next best step in managing this patient is to address and treat his symptoms related to his peripheral arterial disease."

She denied the presence of a cough or sputum production and did not suffer from haemoptysis or calf pain. Other than a successful external cephalic version for a breech presentation five days ago and a placenta praevia which spontaneously resolved, her pregnancy was unremarkable. She was in good health with an unremarkable past medical history and normal routine investigations throughout her pregnancy. She smoked 15 cigarettes per day and did not consume alcohol. Her mother suffered from an unexplained deep vein thrombosis when she was 42 years old but otherwise her family history was unremarkable.\n\nInitial examination revealed a heart rate of 122bpm, respiratory rate 24/min, oxygen saturations of 98% on air, a temperature of 37.6\u00baC and a blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg.

This is also associated with an absence of P waves, except for P wave inversion in the inferior leads, otherwise known as retrograde conduction. These findings are in keeping with atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia, or AVNRT, the most common form of supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nThe correct management option in the above scenario is intravenous verapamil . All five of the above options can be used in patients with supraventricular tachycardia, however, verapamil is the most appropriate given the patient's clinical state and past medical history of asthma.\n\nFollowing advanced life support algorithms, DC cardioversion should be used in narrow complex tachyarrhythmias when the patient is unstable. The above scenario does not describe evidence of heart failure, syncope, chest pain, or haemodynamic instability (shock). This option is therefore incorrect.\n\nIntravenous adenosine 12mg is used in chemical cardioversion of narrow complex tachyarrhythmias, however, should only be used when 6mg of adenosine has failed to cardiovert. Furthermore, adenosine is contraindicated in patients with asthma. For these reasons, this option is incorrect.\n\nIntravenous adenosine 6mg is often the initial medical management in narrow complex tachyarrhythmias. Although this would normally be the next option in management, adenosine is contraindicated in patients with asthma, making this option incorrect.\n\nIntravenous metoprolol is also an option in the management of supraventricular tachycardias. Cardioversion is caused by heart rate reduction leading to selftermination of the tachyarrhythmia. However, due to the patient's asthma history, beta-blockers should be avoided.\n\nDiscuss (11)Improve"

Acute fatty liver is another serious condition, which also has associations with pre-eclampsia. It would typically cause greater elevations in liver enzymes and a deep jaundice. Hyperuricaemia may be a useful marker of pre-eclampsia and does not necessarily indicate an attack of gout. Urate is thought to rise due to diminished kidney function and reduced clearance. Hyperemesis gravidarum should be a diagnosis of exclusion and would be unlikely to present for the first time this late into pregnancy.\n\nDiscuss (3)Improve"

AVRC is a condition inherited with an autosomal dominant pattern, which is characterised by replacement of the normal right ventricular myocardium with fibrofatty tissue. It typically presents in the 2nd-4th decade of life with palpitations, syncope or sudden cardiac death and is a cause of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The resting ECG is typically abnormal and may demonstrate T wave inversion in V1-V3. The mildly elevated troponin in this case is simply secondary to ventricular tachycardia. Imaging will demonstrate structural and functional abnormalities of the right ventricle.\n\nBrugada syndrome is incorrect. This is also an inherited cause of sudden cardiac death (autosomal dominant) but it traditionally causes a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and the resting ECG is characterized by 'coved' ST segment elevation &gt;2mm in &gt;1 of V1-V3 followed by a negative T wave.\n\nCatecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia is incorrect. This is an inherited cause of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death characterized by palpitations, syncope of cardiac arrest precipitated by exercise or emotions. It is typically associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as suggested by the name. Usually, the resting ECG is normal.\n\nRight ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (RVOT-VT) is incorrect. Idiopathic RVOT-VT is not an inherited condition and the resting ECG is normal.\n\nRomano-Ward syndrome is incorrect. This is a cause of congenital long QT syndrome, which can cause a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. We are told there are no abnormalities on the resting ECG apart from T wave inversion.

The patient has high grade atrioventricular (AV) block (2nd degree, Mobitz type II). This is characterised by intermittent non-conduction of P waves associated with a prolonged PR interval. In contrast to Mobitz type I, the PR interval is constantly prolonged and does not progressively lengthen. Mobitz type II is typically caused by significant structural damage to the conducting system. Mobitz II is much more likely than Mobitz I to degenerate to haemodynamic compromise and progress to complete heart block. Pacemaker insertion is warranted. It should be a dual chamber pacemaker on setting DDD or DDDR. DDD pacing means that the pacemaker can record both atrial and ventricular rates and can pace either chamber as necessary. DDDR is the same but can adjust the heart rate to account for the need for higher cardiac output.\n\nAtropine is incorrect. 2nd degree AV block is typically not responsive to atropine. Additionally, while this patient certainly needs a pacemaker, he is now asymptomatic with no adverse features and therefore does not need atropine urgently.\n\nBiventricular implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) insertion is incorrect. This is typically indicated in patients with an ejection fraction of &lt; 35% and symptomatic heart failure. It is not strictly inserted for high risk bradyarrhythmias.\n\nMonitoring is incorrect.

You are called to see him overnight as he is experiencing chest pain, worse on breathing. An ECG is performed and displayed below.

The ECG shows pacing spikes immediately preceding QRS complexes, indicating ventricular (VVI) pacing with good capture. This patient has a degree of heart block underlying his paced rhythm, hence the discordance between the p waves and the QRS complexes, and the reason why the patient is paced.\n\nAAI pacing would show pacing spikes prior to p waves, and in instances of heart block as shown here there would be abnormal or potentially absent conduction to the ventricles. As the pacing spikes are associated with the QRS complex here, AAI cannot be the mode in use.\n\nAlthough this patient may have complete heart block , there is good capture as shown by a 1:1 ratio between pacing spikes and subsequent QRS complexes. Therefore loss of capture is an incorrect answer.\n\nDDD pacing refers to the pacing of both the atria and ventricles. Although this can be useful post-operatively to increase cardiac output, it is not being used here. DDD pacing would either show pacing of the atria (pacing spikes before p waves) or tracking of the patient's intrinsic atrial rate (ventricular pacing spikes that follow p waves and immediately precede QRS complexes).\n\nPain is very common following a sternotomy and is classically sharp and pleuritic. It can be difficult to interpret ischaemia on a paced ECG however the Sgarbossa criteria is a useful tool for this. As this patient does not fit this criterion, and the pain is classical for sternotomy pain rather than cardiac, myocardial infarction is unlikely.\n\nDiscuss (2)Improve"

Patients presenting with a superficial vein thrombosis are at increased risk of a venous thromboembolic event and up to 20% of patients will already have a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on presentation. Patients are more likely to have thrombus extension into the deep venous system if they have more than 5cm of thrombus within 10cm of the saphenofemoral junction (i.e. within the proximal long saphenous vein).\n\nThe evidence for how superficial vein thrombosis should be managed comes from a Cochrane review and is used to support the Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network (SIGN) guidelines on the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism (guide 122). The guidelines recommend that all patients with clinical signs of a superficial vein thrombosis should have an ultrasound scan to exclude a DVT.\n\nPatients with a confirmed diagnosis of a superficial vein thrombosis should be considered for treatment with anti-embolism stockings and prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for 30 days or fondaparinux for 45 days. In cases where LMWH is contraindicated, 8-12 days of oral non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be offered as this has been shown to reduce the risk of thrombus extension."

Up to 85% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) will exhibit liver cysts by the age of 30. Other complications include intracranial aneurysm and heart valve disease. Affected heart valves can occur in up to 25% of ADPKD patients and of them the majority have mitral valve prolapse. The majority of patients with mitral valve prolapse with be asymptomatic but when symptoms are present mitral valve prolapse has to be considered and investigated with an echocardiogram.\n\nThe 'click' coupled with the knowledge of the underlying ADPKD makes the murmur heard in this patient that of a mitral valve prolapse. The prolapse can worsen and cause a secondary mitral regurgitation leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath. The narrow pulse pressure present also suggests an element of left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nDiscuss (4)Improve"

This may be associated with headache, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds. The treatment is to lower the blood pressure within 24-48 hours and oral antihypertensive medications are recommended. Hospitalisation is not required. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and a potent antihypertensive that can be used in this situation.\n\nIntravenous antihypertensives like labetalol, glyceryltrinitrate are used in hypertensive emergencies which require lowering of blood pressure within minutes to hours e.g hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection. Sublingual nifedipine is not recommended for treatment of hypertensive crises."

She is 33 weeks pregnant and thus steroids would be recommended prior to delivery if possible to aid the maturation of her child's lungs. She does not have any evidence of a liver haematoma, disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemodynamic instability and thus she does not need an immediate delivery at this stage. Induction of labour would not be appropriate as her child is breech.\n\nDifferentials would include cholecystitis and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).\n\nIV antibiotics would be appropriate in the treatment of cholecystitis, but this patient has no features of infection, going against a diagnosis of cholecystitis.\n\nPlasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma would be the recommended treatment for TTP, however, TTP would typically present with neurological symptoms such as confusion, headaches, and seizures in severe cases, which our patient does not have."

A friend attends with him and states that some of the lads had taken MCAT (Mephedrone) but he is unsure whether Michael also took MCAT. Michael felt well when he woke up but realised that he was late for his football match so rushed out of the house without any breakfast. He had just scored the first goal of the match when he collapsed. When he came around he complained of palpitations.\n\nHis past medical history includes asthma and hay fever for which he takes regular antihistamines. During the ambulance ride to hospital the paramedic performed some observations and an ECG. He was found to have a blood glucose of 3.6 and was given some GlucoGel and a biscuit. Other observations included a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 135/min which was irregular, irregular in character, respiratory rate of 16/min, afebrile.\n\nThe emergency department doctor reviewed the ECG and diagnosed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response and prescribed digoxin in view of his asthma history and blood pressure readings. The patient had a normal QTc. Five minutes later the cardiac monitor showed a broad complex tachycardia and Michael became unresponsive.\n\nWhat was the cause of the patient's collapse?\n\n- f) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- g) MCAT related arrhythmia\n- h) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n- i) Alcohol induced atrial fibrillation\n- j) Torsades de pointes\n\n## Correct answer is c.\n\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a disorder of the conduction system also known as a pre-excitation syndrome. The incidence of WPW is between 0.1% and 0.3% in the general population. Sudden cardiac death in people with WPW is rare (incidence of less than 0.6%).\n\nIn WPW there is an abnormal accessory pathway called the 'Bundle of Kent' found between the atria and ventricles. If this pathway is used signals may stimulate the ventricles to contract prematurely, resulting in atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.\n\nNormally the AV node acts as a gatekeeper limiting the amount of electrical activity that can reach the ventricles. If a patient has an arrhythmia whereby the atria generate an excessively fast rhythm such as atrial flutter or fibrillation the AV node is able to reduce the amount of electrical activity that reaches the ventricles. However, the Bundle of Kent does not possess the ability to limit the electrical signals to the ventricles. If the person has an atrial arrhythmia the signals can pass down the bundle and cause the ventricles to contract at the same rate. In the extreme heart rates and when the accessory pathway is used the patient may develop dangerous cardiac arrhythmias which can trigger ventricular fibrillation and lead to death.\n\nIn WPW certain medications that can block the AV node or those that can enhance conduction down the accessory pathway by increasing the refractory period in the AV node should be avoided. These include digoxin, adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil, other calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. In this case, the patient's WPW was worsened by administration of digoxin and her arrhythmia developed into ventricular fibrillation.\n\nPeople with WPW are usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may complain of shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness and syncope. Diagnosis is usually made by ECG as patients may have the characteristic 'delta wave'. Patients may also be found to be in atrial fibrillation or have SVT Treatment can include cardioversion in emergencies otherwise amiodarone. Definitive treatment would be ablation."

It is present between the high and mid right atrium, demonstrating the presence of a left-to-right shunt. Primum ASD defects typically occur lowering in the septum than secundum defects, which typically can be found in the mid-atrial region."

He is transferred to CCU and started on secondary prevention medication.\n\n24 hours after his presentation he becomes bradycardic at 34bpm and his blood pressure falls to 80/47 mmHg. He denies chest pain but feels dizzy and light headed. His cardiac monitor shows 3rd-degree heart block.

Complete heart block is a recognised complication of both inferior and anterior STEMI. Inferior STEMI CHB is usually more transient and they only require treatment if they become symptomatic. Anterior STEMI CHB is a more serious complication and they are more likely to need a permanent pacing system. In this case, as he has not responded to atropine then isoprenaline infusion is unlikely to work. There is no suggestion of repeat infarction so angiography is not indicated. He will require a temporary pacing wire to be placed."

His vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 120 bpm, respirations 25 bpm and temperature 37.9 \u00baC.\n\nThe 12 lead ECG showed:\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation?\n\n\n\n- f) Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction\n- g) Pulmonary embolism\n- h) ST elevation myocardial infarction\n- i) Severe hypokalaemia\n- j) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\nThe ECG shows sinus tachycardia with right axis deviation, P pulmonale, Q waves in lead III and inverted T waves in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) and lead III.\n\nPulmonary embolism is the correct answer. Although the ECG is neither sensitive nor specific for pulmonary embolism, the classical findings of S1Q3T3 highly suggest right ventricular strain. Hence, the clinical picture is highly suspicious for pulmonary embolism, and the patient should promptly have an urgent CT pulmonary angiogram and thrombolysis if indicated. Other acute causes for right ventricular strain, like pneumothorax, upper airway obstruction and exacerbation of asthma/COPD, should also be considered in the differentials.\n\nNon ST elevation myocardial infarction is incorrect. ECG changes like ST depression or T wave inversion in NSTEMI are often non-specific. If new, the Twave inversions in this patient may suggest acute coronary syndrome, particularly right ventricular infarction, given the right ventricular strain pattern; however, NSTEMI is unlikely to cause collapse. The classical S1Q3T3 pattern in ECG, along with the clinical findings of tachycardia, tachypnoea and low-grade temperature, is more suggestive of pulmonary embolism in this patient.\n\nST elevation myocardial infarction is incorrect. Classically, STEMI is diagnosed if there is &gt; 1-2 mm ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads or a new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Both of these are not found in this patient's ECG.\n\nSevere hypokalaemia is incorrect. Although hypokalaemia may present with Twave inversions in the precordial leads, there are no ST depression or U waves commonly seen in hypokalaemia. While hypokalaemia can cause muscle tetany, paralysis and respiratory failure, it is unlikely to cause collapse.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is incorrect. ECG changes like T wave inversion in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are often non-specific. Moreover, the classical S1Q3T3\n\npattern in ECG, along with the clinical findings of tachycardia, tachypnoea and lowgrade temperature, is more suggestive of pulmonary embolism in this patient."

For the past year, he has experienced exertional chest pain, which initially only came on whilst walking uphill, but has now started to affect him when walking on the flat.

This patient has a likely diagnosis of stable angina, as he suffers from exertional chest pain which is alleviated by the use of GTN spray. As he is currently taking a beta-blocker at the maximum permissible dose, the next most appropriate step in management is to add in a calcium channel blocker. In this scenario, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred to non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, due to the increased risk of the latter causing complete heart block in combination with beta-blockers.\n\nRefer for assessment for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG is incorrect. As the patient has stable angina, with no symptoms at rest, he does not warrant urgent referral for PCI. Non-urgent referral for PCI or CABG would be appropriate if his symptoms were not improved by the addition of amlodipine.\n\nStart isosorbide mononitrate is incorrect. This would be an appropriate third-line management option for stable angina in this patient if amlodipine failed to alleviate his symptoms. However, it should only be started whilst awaiting assessment for revascularization with PCI or CABG.\n\nStart ranolazine is incorrect. This would also be more appropriate as a third-line management option whilst awaiting specialist assessment for PCI or CABG.\n\nStart verapamil is incorrect.
