## Question # 1

A 74-year-old woman with a history of diverticular disease and Graves' disease presents with lower abdominal pain, fever and bloody diarrhoea. She has a CT of the abdomen with contrast, which confirms diverticulitis. This responds well to treatment, and she is discharged.

The patient is readmitted three weeks later in fast atrial fibrillation. On assessment, she reports a one-week history of palpitations, non-bloody diarrhoea and feeling hot all the time. She continues to smoke 5 cigarettes per day and denies recent coryzal symptoms.

On examination, she has an irregular pulse of 134 bpm and a BP of 132/88 mmHg. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with active bowel sounds. A non-tender goitre is present.

Her investigations:

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | < 0.05 mU/L   | (0.5-5.5)   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 24 pmol/L     | (9.0 - 18)  |

What is the most likely cause of her presentation?

- a) Administration of contrast
- b) De Quervain's thyroiditis
- c) Further episode of diverticulitis
- d) Riedel's thyroiditis
- e) Smoking

Correct answer is a.

Thyrotoxicosis may develop in patients following the administration of contrast, particularly if a background of thyroid disease

Administration of contrast is the correct answer here. This can precipitate thyrotoxicosis in patients with a history of previous thyroid disease. IV contrast results in a load of iodine to the thyroid, resulting in increased secretion of thyroid hormones and hyperthyroidism, which can develop over 2-12 weeks.

De Quervain's thyroiditis often follows an upper respiratory viral illness and usually presents with a painful goitre. In this case, the patient denies coryzal symptoms and has a non-tender goitre, making this diagnosis less likely.

Though a further episode of diverticulitis is possible, the vignette suggests a clinical resolution, and this diagnosis would be unlikely with a soft, non-tender abdomen.

Patients with Riedel's thyroiditis classically present with clinical and biochemical features consistent with hypothyroidism, which is not the case here.

While the patient has a history of smoking , her intake has not drastically increased. Furthermore, smoking induces mild hyperthyroidism, so this is unlikely to be the cause of her presentation in this case.

## Question #2

A 71-year-old gentleman presents to clinic for review. He has recently been diagnosed with type two diabetes following screening by his GP. His HbA1c has not responded to dietary changes that he was advised on. He has a past medical history of bladder cancer for which he had chemotherapy, hypertension, macular degeneration, eczema and chronic kidney disease. His baseline eGFR is 28ml/min/1.73m2.

## Blood tests:

Na +

139 mmol/l

K +

4.4 mmol/l

Urea

6.2 mmol/l

Creatinin

e

214 µmol/l

What is the most appropriate medication to start?

- a) Metformin
- b) Sulfonylurea
- c) Pioglitazone
- d) Insulin
- e) GLP-1 mimetic

The correct answer is a sulfonylurea. This is a patient with new type two diabetes and initial treatment would normally be metformin, but since the eGFR is &lt;30ml/minute/1.73m2 metformin is contraindicated. The next step would be either a a dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. However, pioglitazone should not be offered to a patient with a history of bladder cancer. Therefore that leaves sulfonylurea as the correct answer. Insulin and GLP-1 mimetic could be used further down in the treatment algorithm.

## Question #3

A 29-year-old nulligravida woman attends her GP as she has not menstruated for 6 months. Menarche was at age 14. She had irregular periods from age 14-16, and then took oral hormonal contraception until last year when she got married. The patient does not know her family history as she is adopted. She is otherwise fit and well, enjoying running recreationally and eating healthy. She does not drink, smoke or use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are normal and body mass index is 22 kg/m².

Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine pregnancy test is negative.

Which of the following is the most appropriate screening test for this patient?

- a) Karyotype
- b) MRI of the pituitary
- c) Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone
- d) Serum prolactin
- e) Ultrasound of the pelvis

Correct answer is d.

The patients presentation is consistent with secondary amenorrhoea. The first investigative step is normally to do a pregnancy test, which in this case is negative. There are no obvious explanations for secondary amenorrhoea from her presentation. Hence the next step is to obtain serum prolactin, TSH and FSH blood results (as this will help differentiate between the most common causes of secondary amenorrhoea following pregnancy: hyperprolactinaemia, thyroid dysfunction and premature ovarian failure respectively).

Choice 1: Premature ovarian insufficiency is characterised by elevated FSH and low oestradiol. A karyotype may be considered if Turner syndrome or fragile X syndrome is suspected, as these patients usually have ovarian dysfunction. However, this patient has no dysmorphic features or other co-morbidities to warrant karyotype evaluation.

Choice 2: An MRI of the pituitary should be performed in patients with persistently elevated prolactin (with or without galactorrhoea), unexplained headaches, bitemporal hemianopia or other concerning neurologic findings. It is not an appropriate screening test in this patient.

Choice 3: Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated in non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a condition that presents with hyperandrogenism in late childhood. This patient has no findings of androgen excess (e.g. male pattern hair distribution, severe acne).

Choice 5: An ultrasound may be indicated in patients with abnormal pelvic pain, pelvic organ enlargement or masses on examination, or signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g. polycystic ovarian syndrome, androgen tumour), none of which are seen in this patient.

## Question #4

A 40-year-old female presented to Endocrinology Clinic with a 3-month history of weight gain, fatigue and headaches. Over the last 3 weeks, she has also experienced galactorrhoea and reduced libido. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 1 month ago and is on diet control for both. She is not currently on any regular medications. On examination, there was evidence of hirsutism and acne, a cervical fat pad, striae on her abdomen and proximal myopathy. Areas of hyperpigmentation were noted on her mucous membrane and palmar creases.

Which of the following investigations will reveal the diagnosis?

- a) Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
- b) Prolactin levels
- c) Urinary cortisol
- d) CT brain
- e) MRI pituitary

Correct answer is e.

The history suggests Cushing's syndrome, but the occurrence of galactorrhoea and reduced libido brings to attention the possibility of hyperprolactinaemia, and headaches may indicate an intracranial pathology. The diagnosis of a secreting pituitary tumour causing a raised level of prolactin and ACTH (causing hyperpigmentation) and hence, cortisol, should be suspected.

Low dose dexamethasone suppression test and 24-hour urinary cortisol will aid confirming the presence of Cushing's syndrome. Raised prolactin levels will confirm hyperprolactinaemia, however, it is the MRI pituitary that will lead to the diagnosis of a pituitary tumour.

## Question #5

You review a 38-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus in clinic. Her diabetes is currently controlled with a basal-bolus regime. She takes no other medication apart from citalopram 20mg od for depression. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 13 years. Her most recent bloods show:

Na +

142 mmol/l

K +

3.9 mmol/l

Urea

4.9 mmol/l

Creatinin e

79 µmol/l

Total cholesterol

4.4 mmol/l

HDL cholesterol

1.2 mmol/l

LDL cholesterol

1.8 mmol/l

Triglyceride

1.3 mmol/l

Urine dip: No protein or blood

What is the most appropriate management with regards to lipid modification?

- a) Start atorvastatin 10mg on
- b) Start atorvastatin 20mg on
- c) Start atorvastatin 40mg on
- d) Perform a QRISK2 assessment
- e) Reassure her that lipid modification therapy is not required at this stage

Correct answer is b.

NICE specifically state that we should not use QRISK2 for type 1 diabetics. Instead, the following criteria are used:

-  older than 40 years, or
-  have had diabetes for more than 10 years or
-  have established nephropathy or
-  have other CVD risk factors

This patient has had diabetes for 25 years so we should start atorvastatin 20mg on.

## Question #6

You review a 68-year-old patient in the diabetic clinic. He was diagnosed 28 years ago with type 2 diabetes and over this time has been through a number of antiglycemic agents including biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones and insulin. He is generally well but reports painless macroscopic haematuria and would like to be referred to a urologist as he has read about bladder cancer associated with one of his medications.

Which of the following antiglycemic agents can cause bladder cancer?

- a) Gliclazide
- b) Tolbutamide
- c) Pioglitazone
- d) Insulin detemir
- e) Sitagliptin

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer Answer: Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. The greatest risk was shown in those patients who have used pioglitazone long term.

## Question #7

A 47-year-old woman is admitted to the surgical ward with severe loin to groin abdominal pain. A CT-KUB reveals a right-sided renal calculus. When you clerk her in she admits to you that she has not felt herself for the past few weeks with polyuria, polydipsia, constipation and altered mood.

Blood tests show:

| Estimated glomerular filtration rate   | >60 ml/min                  |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Adjusted calcium                       | 3.1 mmol/l (2.1-2.6 mmol/l) |
| Phosphate                              | 0.6 mmol/l (0.8-1.4 mol/l)  |
| Parathyroid hormone                    | 5.1 pmol/l (1.2-5.8 pmol/l) |

Which of the following is the most likely cause for her symptoms?

- a) Primary hyperparathyroidism
- b) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- c) Sarcoidosis
- d) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
- e) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis

The PTH level in primary hyperparathyroidism may be normal

The most likely diagnosis here is primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. The classical biochemical findings are a high serum calcium and low phosphate. The parathyroid hormone level is either high or inappropriately normal.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by chronic hypocalcaemia (e.g. chronic kidney disease). Serum calcium is low or normal whilst parathyroid hormone levels are high.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops from secondary hyperparathyroidism and results in autonomous parathyroid production. It is usually seen patients with end-stage renal disease.

Sarcoidosis and type 1 renal tubular acidosis are rare causes of hypercalcaemia.

## Question #8

A 76 year old woman was admitted to hospital after presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath, productive cough and palpitations. A chest x-ray demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia and ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response. Initial management included intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids and oral digoxin loading.

Two days after admission, the patient's condition had significantly improved and she was able to start mobilising on the ward. The palpitations that she had been experiencing at presentation had also ceased. Following review by the Senior House Officer on the ward round, a repeat ECG was requested when demonstrated that the patient had cardioverted back to sinus rhythm. Digoxin therapy was subsequently held.

To investigate for an underlying cause of atrial fibrillation, thyroid function tests were added to blood tests from admission, with results as listed below.

| Haemoglobin                 | 125 g / dL       |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| White cell count            | 13.7* 10 9 /l    |
| Neutrophils                 | 11.9* 10 9 /l    |
| Platelets                   | 351 * 10 9 /l    |
| Urea                        | 4.6 mmol / L     |
| Creatinine                  | 130 micromol / L |
| Sodium                      | 139 mmol / L     |
| Potassium                   | 3.6 mmol / L     |
| C-reactive protein          | 105 mg / L       |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone | 0.25 microU / L  |
| T4 free serum               | 14.1 pmol / L    |
| T3 free serum               | 7.4 pmol / L     |

What is the most appropriate next investigation to assess deranged thyroid function tests?

- a) Thyroid ultrasound
- b) Thyroid peroxidase antibody levels
- c) Repeat TFT in 6 weeks
- d) Thyroid scintiscanning
- e) Thyroglobulin antibody levels

Correct answer is .c

Sick euthyroid is common in unwell, elderly patients and often needs no treatment

Any acute and severe illness may alter thyroid hormone deiodination through the effects of cytokines and result in various changes in levels of TSH, fT3 and fT4. Low TSH levels in hospitalised patients are three times more likely to be due to this effect than to hyperthyroidism.

It is therefore best to avoid thyroid function testing around the time of an acute illness unless there is good clinical evidence of a primary thyroid illness. If TFT remain deranged following recovery from acute illness then further investigation to assess for thyroid disease can be considered.

## Question #9

You are asked to review a patient with hyperglycaemia on the ward. The patient is a 58-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The nurse states that her capillary blood glucose is 12.8 mmol/l. Her drug history includes Humulin M3 (28 units before breakfast, and 38 units before evening meal). She had her normal insulin with breakfast at 07:30.

You review her at 11:30. The patient denies polyuria or polydipsia. She is clinically euvolaemic. She is medically stable and awaiting discharge from physiotherapy. You ask the nurse to check plasma ketones which return at 0.4mmol/l. On review of her insulin chart, you note that her blood glucose levels are usually well controlled.

How will you manage this patient?

- a) 6 units of actrapi
- b) Reassurance to the patient and nurse and continue monitoring
- c) Intravenous insulin sliding scale
- d) Diabetic ketoacidosis protocol
- e) Increase Humulin M3 to 32 units before breakfast starting the following day

## Correct answer is b.

When managing hyperglycaemia in an insulin dependent diabetic, avoid the use of stat insulin, unless the patient is symptomatic or has high ketones (&gt;0.6 mmol/l). It is safer to increase the 'usual' insulin if persistently hyperglycaemic

The patient has had a once off 'blip' in blood glucose control. When managing hyperglycaemia in an insulin dependent diabetic, you should avoid the use of stat insulin, unless the patient is symptomatic or has high ketones (&gt;0.6 mmol/l). It is far safer to increase the 'usual' insulin if persistently hyperglycaemic.

The patient is medically stable, asymptomatic, and the ketones are at a satisfactory level. Therefore the patient and nurse should be reassured, and the blood glucose level monitored.

If the patient had frequent high blood sugars then it would be appropriate to titrate the normal insulin up.

An intravenous insulin sliding scale is indicated when the patient is undergoing fasting and will be missing more than one meal.

The diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol should be implemented in patients with DKA which is diagnosed when ketones are significantly elevated (&gt; 3 mmol/l) and the patient is acidotic (HCO3 &lt; 15).

## Question #10

A 47-year-old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoes a thyroidectomy for Graves' disease. Initially, her symptoms settle. However, on postoperative scans, residual thyroid tissue is noted and after several months, her symptoms recur, including palpitations from atrial fibrillation. She is referred for radioiodine therapy.

Three days before the radioiodine administration is due, she is admitted with acute-onset abdominal pain and, given the history of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic colitis is suspected. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen is performed with contrast, which rules out any acute pathology and so she is discharged.

With regards to the radioiodine therapy, when is the earliest that this can take place?

- a) 3 days
- b) 2 weeks
- c) 8 weeks
- d) 16 weeks
- e) 26 weeks

Correct answer is c.

Radioiodine therapy should be avoided until 8 weeks following CT contrast administration

Iodine in intravenous contrast interferes with the administration of radioiodine. As the levels of iodine in contrast are several hundred-fold higher than the recommended daily allowance, this may be retained by the body for months. As such, it can interfere with therapeutic uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. Various studies have demonstrated a 6-8 week time period is the minimum to wait before administering radioiodine, following CT contrast. 8 weeks is therefore the correct answer.

Going ahead with the procedure as planned, 3 days after this CT scan with contrast is therefore too soon. The contrast would interfere with the radioiodine.

Similarly, 2 weeks is still too soon to go ahead with the administration.

16 weeks is an unnecessarily long amount of time to wait - 8 weeks is sufficient according to current studies.

Similarly, 26 weeks is longer than needed - the question asks what the earliest time of administration should be.

## Question #11

You are called to see a 35-year-old man on the Acute Medical Unit who is having a seizure.

He was admitted 2 days ago having presented acutely agitated to the Emergency Department. He gave a 10-year history of alcohol overuse and at that time had not had an alcoholic drink in 24 hours following an argument with his girlfriend where he vowed to give up alcohol. Prior to this he had been drinking 4-6 litres of cider per day plus additional spirits in variable amounts. He was admitted for detox and prescribed chlordiazepoxide, pabrinex and fluids. He has no other past medical history.

Nursing staff inform you that the patient has had no other seizures on this admission and has been eating and drinking small amounts today. However, he has been complaining of all over body pain and became confused 2-3 hours ago. The seizure is generalised tonic-clonic and self terminates after 3 minutes.

On examination post-seizure the patient is drowsy but responding to voice. His saturations are 100% on 15 litres oxygen via non-rebreathe mask and his temperature is 37.2 ºC. His heart rate is 110 beats per minute and blood pressure is 126/72 mmHg. His chest is clear, abdomen soft and non-tender and there is no focal neurology.

Repeat blood tests and arterial blood gas are taken.

Which electrolyte abnormality is most likely to have caused his seizure?

- a) Hypocalcaemia
- b) Hypoglycaemia
- c) Hypokalaemia
- d) Hypomagnesaemia

## e) Hypophosphataemia

Correct answer is e.

Hypophosphataemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality during alcohol withdrawal and is a recognised cause of seizures. It is often present at baseline in alcoholic patients and can further decrease in withdrawal. It is thought that this is due to effects on the proximal renal tubule. It can cause muscle pain and disorientation at very low levels (&lt; 0.3 mmol/l).

Hypoglycaemia would also be possible but in the absence of diabetes, and with the patient eating and drinking, this is less likely. Hypoglycaemia is common in patients intoxicated with alcohol and these patients should be monitored with regular capillary blood glucose testing.

Low magnesium and low calcium both cause seizures but are unlikely to be lowered sufficiently in this patient to result in seizures in the absence of other clinical signs.

Low potassium is unlikely to result in seizures.

## Question #12

A 62-year-old patient presents to review in the diabetes clinic. He has had type 2 diabetes for 10 years, as well as previous appendectomy, kidney stones, previous tibial fracture and depression which is now in remission. He takes metformin and gliclazide only and has no allergies. His HbA1c is 40mmol/mol, urine dip is negative for glucose and protein but his blood pressure is 151/96mmHg. He has previously attempted to control his blood pressure by diet and exercise only. He is a white Caucasian. What is the most appropriate plan in regards to blood pressure management?

- a) Start a beta-blocke
- b) Start a thiazide-like diuretic
- c) Start an ACE inhibitor
- d) Start an angiotensin II receptor blocker
- e) Start a calcium channel blocker

Correct answer is c.

A patient with T2DM with a new diagnosis of hypertension should be treated with an ACE inhibitor as first line treatment, regardless of age

The correct answer is to start a ACE inhibitor. This is because he has diabetes. A patient with diabetes should have an ACE inhibitor as first line treatment for diabetes regardless of their age. If the patient did not have diabetes, then a calcium channel blocker would be the most appropriate option. If the patient could not tolerate a ACE inhibitor then an angiotensin II receptor blocker should be tried. ACE inhibitors should also start for patients with diabetes if there is proteinuria, and therefore should have at least annual urinary albumin to creatinine ratios measured. Beta-blockers are only used after ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and alpha blockers have failed to controlled blood pressure. However, IV labetalol can be used in hypertensive emergencies to reduce blood pressure.

## Question #13

An 85-year-old woman is brought into A+E with hypothermia, sinus bradycardia and unresponsive. A CT head reveals no acute intra-cranial pathology. Passive warming and intravenous fluids are commenced. Subsequent blood tests reveal the panel below. A collateral history from family members reveals symptoms of lethargy, cold intolerance and weight gain over the last few months.

TS H

&gt;30.0 mU/L

T3

&lt;0.05 mU/L

What is the most appropriate initial treatment?

- a) Levothyroxine and Liothyronine
- b) Levothyroxine
- c) Lugol's iodine
- d) Liothyronine
- e) Carbimazole

## Correct answer is a.

This is myxedema coma, which is rare but has a high mortality rate. Administration of both liothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) is the most appropriate treatment. Liothyronine (T3) has a greater biologic activity and faster onset than levothyroxine (T4) and should be continued until there is clinical improvement. The administration of hydrocortisone is also important as patients there may be coexisting adrenal insufficiency (primary or secondary). Supportive measures are important such as re-warming, fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction and vasopressors if required.

Carbimazole is used for hyperthyroidism.

Lugols iodine is used for rapid control of hyperthyroidism such as a thyroid storm or prior to a total thyroidectomy for poor medical compliance.

## Question #14

A 37-year-old female presents with 4 days of generally unwell and a recent dysuria. Her urine is foul smelling and dark. She is a known type 1 diabetic with a long-standing subcutaneous insulin regime. Her pH on admission was 7.24, bicarbonate 8 mmol/l and blood glucose 32 mmol/l. Urinary dip leucocytes 2+, nitrites2+ and 4+ ketones. She was started on treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids and fixed rate insulin. She also has intravenous antibiotics for a urinary source of sepsis. You are asked to review her blood sugars at 4 hours after treatment was initiated. What should be the aim in managing hyperglycaemia in a diabetic ketoacidosis patient?

- a) Reduce blood glucose to under 14 mmol/l as quickly as possible
- b) Reduce blood glucose by 3mmol/l per hour
- c) Reduce blood glucose by 6 mmol/l per hour
- d) Aim blood glucose above 18 mmol/l
- e) Blood glucose does not require monitoring if insulin infusion is running3

Correct answer is b.

The most recent guidelines by the Joint British Diabetes Societies Inpatient Care Group in September 2012 recommends a reduction in blood glucose of 3 mmol/l per hour until BM reaches 14 mmol/l, at which point 5% dextrose should be considered as the intravenous fluid of choice. Rapid glucose lowering should be avoided: the rapid flux in osmolality can result in significant cerebral oedema and resultant cerebral damage.

## Question #15

A 35-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology clinic after having lost 5kg without any change in diet or exercise habits. On direct questioning, she also describes that she has noticed feeling warmer, losing sleep, and a slight tremor in her hands. She has a past medical history of depression for which she takes sertraline. She has no other medical problems. On examination, she has a body mass index of 24 kg/m², a slight tremor at rest, and a large goitre. This is nontender and there are no palpable nodules. There is no lymphoadenopathy present. Blood tests show a normal full blood count and electrolytes, but TSH is undetectable and free T4 is 39pmol/l. She is clinically diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. What further investigation is most appropriate to determine the type of her hyperthyroidism?

- a) Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies
- b) Liver function tests
- c) CT neck
- d) Scan of radionuclide thyroid uptake
- e) US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology

Correct answer is a.

TSH antibodies are found in 90% of patients with Graves' disease and can help distinguish from other forms of hyperthyroidism

This patient clinically and biochemically has hyperthyroidism. To help determine the cause of hyperthyroidism, and distinguish between causes such as Graves' disease, toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goitre. Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSH-RAb, commonly shortened to TRAb) has an up to 98% sensitivity and 99% specificity for Graves' disease. If this test is negative, then a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan can help determine the cause. In Graves' disease there is diffuse high uptake, in thyroiditis there is low uptake, and if there are nodules then there is uneven uptake. US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology is recommended in the presence of features suggestive of malignancy. Liver function tests are important if there is a history of liver disease as carbimazole can cause further liver injury, but it would not help in determining the cause of hyperthyroidism

## Question #16

A 50-year-old female is admitted with epigastric pain radiating to her back. She has no past medical history and takes no regular medications. Her alcohol history includes 4 glasses of wine per week.

Blood results are as follows:

| Hb           | 115 g/l                                 | Na +       | 138 mmol/l   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets    | 288 * 10 9 /l                           | K +        | 3.8 mmol/l   |
| WBC          | 10.8 * 10 9 /l                          | Urea       | 6.8 mmol/l   |
| Neuts        | 8.8 * 10 9 /l                           | Creatinine | 72 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs       | 1.8 * 10 9 /l                           | CRP        | 84 mg/l      |
| Triglyceride | 12.3 mmol/l (normal range < 2.3 mmol/L) | Bilirubin  | 16 µmol/l    |
| ALT          | 24 u/l                                  | Amylase    | 924 U/L      |
| ALP          | 76 u/l                                  | Albumin    | 38 g/l       |

An abdominal ultrasound is performed:

Abdominal ultrasound report

Np gall stones identified. No intra or extra hepatic duct dilation evident

What treatment will reduce the risk of pancreatitis reoccurrence?

- a) Ursodeoxycholic acid
- b) Fenofibrate
- c) Simvastatin
- d) Nicotinic acid
- e) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Correct answer is a.

Fibrates are the most effective drug for treating hypertriglyceridaemia

The patient has clinical features of pancreatitis. The raised amylase confirms the diagnosis. The two most common causes of pancreatitis in the UK are excess alcohol and gallstones.

The normal liver function tests and ultrasound rule out gallstone disease as the cause. Therefore a laparoscopic cholecystectomy or treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is not indicated.

The patient drinks 4 glasses of wine per week. A 250ml glass of wine at 12% alcohol contains 250 * 0.12 = 30 ml of pure alcohol. 10 ml of pure alcohol = 1 unit. Therefore each glass of wine contains 3 unit. Her alcohol intake per week is therefore 12 units which is within the recommended intake. It is unlikely that alcohol is the cause.

A patient has a significantly high triglyceride level. While gallstones and alcohol account for roughly 80% of cases of pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia is the next most common aetiology, accounting for roughly 1-4% of cases. The exact mechanism is unclear but it is thought to involve increased concentrations of chylomicrons in the blood. These low-density particles are very large and may obstruct capillaries leading to local ischemia and acidaemia. This local damage can expose triglycerides to pancreatic lipases.

Fibrates, statins, and nicotinic acid will all lower triglyceride levels, however, fibrates are the most effective drug in doing so.

## Question #17

A 68-year-old gentleman was admitted to the medical admissions unit with increasing drowsiness. He had been diagnosed with primary small cell carcinoma of the lung six months ago and had declined curative chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis there was no evidence of metastasis, and his past medical history comprised of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and depression.

His wife had taken him to the Emergency Department having noted that he had been increasingly drowsy over the last few hours, as well as developing new onset confusion. He had otherwise been relatively well prior to the admission. He had consulted his GP about new onset generalised aches and pains within the last four weeks for which his GP had commenced Oramorph solution PRN. Since then he had developed abdominal pain which the GP had diagnosed as secondary to opiate-induced constipation and he was accordingly prescribed lactulose 15ml BD with partial relief of his symptoms. There had been no evidence of weakness or numbness and no evidence of speech impairment; as far as his wife was aware he had taken the prescribed dose of oramorph. His drug history comprised of oramorph solution 10mg BD, paracetamol 1g QDS, dihydrocodeine 60mg QDS, lactulose 15ml BD, aspirin 75mg OD, atorvastatin 20mg ON, bisoprolol 2.5mg OD, Ramipril 2.5mg OD and furosemide 40mg OD.

Examination revealed a drowsy gentleman with a GCS of 12 (E 3 M5 V4). His blood pressure was 102/68, heart rate 58bpm, respiratory rate 10/min, oxygen saturations of 95% on air and temperature 36.6ºC. Examination of his cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable. Examination of his central nervous system revealed the presence of normal sized pupils; he was not compliant with formal neurological examination but no other focal neurological signs were found. There was no evidence of neck stiffness and Kernig's sign was negative. He was not cooperative with an abbreviated mental state examination.

Which investigation is most likely to be diagnostic of the underlying cause?

- a) Urgent CT head scan
- b) Urgent serum liver function and calcium profile
- c) Urgent isotope bone scan
- d) Urgent septic screen
- e) Urgent PET scan

This gentleman has developed signs of life-threatening hypercalcaemia, having manifested previous potential symptoms including new onset abdominal pain and constipation. This question is asking what the single next most important investigation should be, and whilst most of the above options are relevant, candidates are asked to discriminate from what is deemed to be the next essential management should be. It is likely that he has developed metastasis to his spine thus whilst an isotope bone scan may be an important part of his overall management, it is not as relevant in the acute setting. Likewise, it is likely that a septic screen and CT head would be performed, but clinically speaking there is little definite evidence of acute raised intracranial pressure or sepsis. There is no indication at present that he is suffering from opiate toxicity and therefore IV naloxone should not be administered at this stage.

## Question #18

A 75-year-old man presents to referred to the diabetic clinic by his general practitioner with newly identified hyperglycaemia. He had presented with a two month history of polyuria, polydipsia and diarrhoea and was found to have a blood sugar of 18.4 mmol/L. Over this time period he had lost 6kg and now weighed 61kg. His past medical history includes hypertension and a deep vein thrombosis which was diagnosed three months ago. He takes amlodipine 10mg and warfarin.

What is the diagnosis?

- a) Glucagonoma
- b) Type one diabetes mellitus
- c) Cushing's syndrome
- d) Drug induced diabetes
- e) Type two diabetes mellitus

Correct answer is a.

Glucagonoma is an uncommon tumour of the pancreatic alpha cells. It can present with new or worsening diabetes mellitus, venous thromboembolism, the classic rash of necrolytic migratory erythema (a painful, pruritic maculopapular rash occuring typically at sites of friction with clothing...) and other symptoms of hyperglucagonaemia (diarrhoea, weight loss, anaemia). Type one diabetes mellitus can of course present with the osmotic symptoms of hyperglycaemia and weight loss but would be unlikely in a patient of this age with no history of autoimmune disease. Type two diabetes mellitus would be uncommon in a non-obese older patient and is less likely to present with osmotic symptoms.

## Question #19

A 62-year-old man comes to the Emergency department with nausea and vomiting which has steadily worsened over the past 2-3 weeks. He had Type 2 diabetes for the past 7 years and is currently treated with metformin, sitagliptin and empagliflozin. He tells you he has lost some 5kg in weight over the past month. On examination his blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, his pulse is 85 beats per minute and regular. Emergency blood testing reveal elevated ketones and a glucose of 12.2 mmol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his glucose

## control?

- a) Add liraglutide
- b) Add long-acting insulin
- c) Change the empagliflozin for liraglutide
- d) Change the empagliflozin for long-acting insulin
- e) Stop the metformin

Correct answer is d.

Given the duration of Type 2 diabetes and the fact that patient has lost weight in the past month, the possibility that he is insulinopenic is raised. In this situation, calorie loss and metabolic disturbance can be exacerbated by the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and patients may present as here, with euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The SGLT-2 inhibitor should be withdrawn, and given he is insulinopaenic, long-acting insulin added.

In this situation the empagliflozin must be withdrawn, therefore options including adding liraglutide and long-acting insulin are incorrect. GLP-1 agonists such as liraglutide work less well in patients who are relatively insulinopenic, so liraglutide is incorrect. Stopping the metformin won't remove the cause of ketosis, the empagliflozin.

## Question #20

A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents for review. As part of his annual health check he has a U&amp;E, HbA1c and cholesterol check done. The following results are obtained:

His blood pressure today is 128/78 mmHg. His only regular medication is ramipril 5mg od.

Na +

HbA1c

45 mmol/mol (6.3%)

His 10-year QRISK2 score is 7%. What is the most appropriate action following these results?

- a) Start atorvastatin 20mg on
- b) Arrange a fasting glucose sample
- c) Diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus
- d) Increase the dose of ramipril
- e) Add amlodipine 5mg od

Correct answer is b.

His QRISK2 score is &lt; 10% so no action needs taking about his cholesterol. His blood pressure is also well controlled

## . Question #21

A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a collapse at the local supermarket. She tells you that she always feels weak and washed out, and hardly ever has any energy. She takes no regular medication and virtually never sees the doctor. On examination her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. She is slim with a body mass index of 21 kg/m², no abnormal physical signs are noted.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Conn's syndrome
- b) Cushing's syndrome
- c) Gitelman's syndrome
- d) Liddle's syndrome
- e) Renal tubular acidosis type

Correct answer is c.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

This patient has hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal / low blood pressure. This fits best with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Bartter's syndrome often presents in infancy as failure to thrive, and isn't listed as a distractor. Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option. Gitelman's is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter, and results in a clinical picture similar to that expected with thiazide diuretic use.

Conn's syndrome is associated with hypertension, as is Liddle's syndrome, effectively ruling them out as diagnoses here. Renal tubular acidosis type 1 is associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis, not with a bicarbonate of 32.

## Question #22

A 75-year-old man with a history of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia was admitted to the emergency department with confusion. His daughter states that this has come on slowly over the last week and prior to this he had no memory problems. He currently takes metformin, ramipril, amlodipine and atorvastatin.

On examination, he smells strongly of urine and his mucous membranes appear dry. His abbreviated mental test score is 7 out of 10 and he is oriented in person but not in place or time. His heart rate is 95 per minute and his blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg. His chest is clear and has a soft ejection systolic murmur which does not radiate. His jugular venous pressure is not visible and he has mild ankle oedema. He has diffuse tenderness in the lower abdomen with no peritonism and normal bowel sounds. He has no focal neurology.

Investigation results are as follows:

Which would be the most appropriate initial resuscitation measure?

- a) 0.45% saline
- b) 0.9% saline
- c) Fixed rate insulin and 0.9% saline
- d) Hartmann's
- e) Sliding scale insulin and 0.9% saline

Correct answer is b.

This gentleman has hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), likely precipitated by urinary tract infection and his pre-existing diabetes.

According to the Joint British Diabetes Society Guidelines for HHS, 0.9% saline is the recommended initial resuscitation fluid, aiming for 3-6 litres positive at 12 hours. This should only be switched to 0.45% saline if osmolality is not declining despite positive fluid balance. Fixed rate insulin should only be added if glucose fails to fall with fluid.

## Question #23

A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department feeling very hot, weight loss and nausea. She has a past medical history of cardiomyopathy for which she an ICD inserted and takes amiodarone due to recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Blood tests show an undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone. She also has rheumatoid arthritis. She has previously had an angiogram showing no evidence of coronary artery disease. She takes methotrexate, aspirin, paracetamol, omeprazole, warfarin and bisoprolol. She is suspected of having acute thyrotoxicosis. What is the most appropriate action in regards to her current medication in addition to stopping amiodarone?

- a) Stop aspirin
- b) Stop omeprazole
- c) Stop bisoprolol
- d) Stop warfarin
- e) Stop paracetamol

Correct answer is a.

In acute thyrotoxicosis, stop aspirin as it can worsen the storm by displacing T4 from thyroid binding globulin

This patient with acute thyrotoxicosis should have amiodarone, the likely cause, of her hyperthyroidism stopped. In addition, aspirin should be stopped. Aspirin binds to thyroxine-binding globulin and displaces bound T4, thereby increasing the levels of free T4.

## Question #24

A 20-year-old female presented to the accident and emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and lethargy. On further questioning she stated that she had been generally unwell for the last four months during which time she lost 10 Kg in weight and had been tired all the time.

Last month she has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was prescribed levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.

Her mother and sister have hypothyroidism and take thyroxine. On examination, she looks unwell and dehydrated.

Her pulse is 105 beats per minute and blood pressure is 70/40 mmHg

Her temperature is 37.6ºC and BMI is 19 kg/m². Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination were normal. Investigations done last month showed:

| Hb         | 9.5 g/dl      |
|------------|---------------|
| MCV        | 105 fl        |
| Platelet s | 190 * 10 9 /l |

| Serum free T4   | 8.5 pmol/l   |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Serum TSH       | 5.5 mU/l     |

While awaiting new investigations, what is the most appropriate immediate treatment for this patient?

- a) Intravenous glucose 10%
- b) Intravenous normal saline
- c) Intravenous normal saline and antibiotics
- d) Intravenous normal saline and hydrocortisone
- e) Intravenous thyroxine

Correct answer is d.

This patient presented with Addisonian crisis (abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration and hypotension). She has been complaining of tiredness and weight loss (which are features of Addisons disease) for four months but what precipitated the crisis is the thyroxine given for the presumed hypothyroidism.

Actually, a slightly raised TSH and a decreased T4 are features of primary hypoadrenalism and do not necessarily indicate frank hypothyroidism.

This is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately with intravenous normal saline and hydrocortisone. Thyroxine should not be given as it will exacerbate the condition.

Her low haemoglobin and high MCV may point towards pernicious anaemia which is an autoimmune disease seen sometimes in association with Addisons disease.

## Question #25

A 48-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology clinic with a 6-week history of weight gain and fatigue.

Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test:

What is the next best investigation?

- a) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- b) Insulin tolerance test
- c) Petrosal sinus ACTH sampling
- d) Pituitary MRI
- e) Urinary cortisol

Correct anser is a.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is useful for distinguishing between ACTH dependent (e.g. pituitary source) and non-ACTH dependent (e.g. ectopic and adrenal source) causes of Cushings's syndrome

This patient has Cushing's syndrome. Due to increased glucocorticoid production, symptoms include weight gain and hyperglycaemia as seen in this patient. Hypertension is another common finding also seen here. Laboratory tests may reveal hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The best test to diagnose Cushing's syndrome is the low-dose dexamethasone test. This has been done for this patient and shows a cortisol level that has not been suppressed despite exogenous steroid use. Once Cushing's syndrome has been confirmed, additional localisation tests need to be completed. One of these includes the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test which is used to discriminate between Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production. Suppressed cortisol levels following high doses of glucocorticoids confirms a pituitary cause, as opposed to normal levels of cortisol that suggest an adrenal cause.

The insulin stress test is used to differentiate Cushing's syndrome from pseudoCushing's. Pseudo-Cushing's presents similarly to Cushing's syndrome; however, rather than being caused by excessive corticosteroid levels, it is due to alcohol excess or severe depression. There is nothing in this patient's history to suggest depression or alcohol excess. Furthermore, the positive finding following the lowdose dexamethasone suppression test points away from a diagnosis of pseudoCushing's.

Petrosal sinus ACTH sampling is another investigation that can be used to help distinguish between a pituitary or adrenal cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is an invasive investigation and easier tests such as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test should be considered first.

A pituitary MRI can be used to diagnose a pituitary cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the next recommended investigation. Rather, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is easier and cheaper to complete and should be completed next.

Urinary cortisol is used as an initial investigation in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is not a specific localisation test.

Question #26

A 75-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) due to increased tiredness and weight gain. Her past medical history includes hypothyroidism and hypertension, for which she takes levothyroxine and amlodipine.

She last saw the GP two weeks previously when she was started on ferrous sulphate due to mild anaemia.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

- a) Bowel malignancy
- b) Addison's disease
- c) Amlodipine toxicity
- d) Undercorrected hypothyroidism
- e) Worsening anaemia

Correct answer is d.

The most likely explanation here is undercorrected hypothyroidism. Ferrous sulphate is well known to reduce the absorption of other medications, particularly levothyroxine. Patients should be advised to take these tablets separately from their regular medications.

Although anaemia in a post-menopausal woman should always be investigated, there are no symptoms to suggest malignancy here. Addison's disease would be unlikely to cause weight gain.

## Question #27

A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a collapse at the local supermarket. She tells you that she always feels weak and washed out, and hardly ever has any energy. She takes no regular medication and virtually never sees the doctor. On examination her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Conn's syndrome
- b) Cushing's syndrome
- c) Gitelman's syndrome
- d) Liddle's syndrome
- e) Renal tubular acidosis type

Correct answer is c.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

This patient has hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal / low blood pressure. This fits best with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Bartter's syndrome often presents in infancy as failure to thrive, and isn't listed as a distractor. Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option. Gitelman's is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter, and results in a clinical picture similar to that expected with thiazide diuretic use.

Conn's syndrome is associated with hypertension, as is Liddle's syndrome, effectively ruling them out as diagnoses here. Renal tubular acidosis type 1 is associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis, not with a bicarbonate of 32.

This gentleman has hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), likely precipitated by urinary tract infection and his pre-existing diabetes.

According to the Joint British Diabetes Society Guidelines for HHS, 0.9% saline is the recommended initial resuscitation fluid, aiming for 3-6 litres positive at 12 hours. This should only be switched to 0.45% saline if osmolality is not declining despite positive fluid balance. Fixed rate insulin should only be added if glucose fails to fall with fluid.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis, based on his clinical profile?

- a) Microprolactinoma
- b) Morbid obesity
- c) Non-functioning pituitary adenoma
- d) Post traumatic pituitary apoplexy
- e) Primary hypothyroidism

Correct answer is c.

The presence of an elevated prolactin level along with secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism is indicative of stalk compression is consistent with a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma

This gentleman has secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism in the presence of elevated prolactin levels, which are indicative of stalk compression due to a pituitary adenoma. A prolactinoma is generally associated with prolactin levels &gt;2000 mU/L. Morbid obesity may be associated with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, although secondary hypothyroidism is unlikely. Pituitary apoplexy is characterized by a sudden onset of headache, visual symptoms, altered mental status, and hormonal dysfunction due to acute hemorrhage or infarction of a pituitary gland. It usually presents with biochemical features of hypopituitarism which is not presented in this scenario. Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by low FT4, low FT3 and high TSH.

## Question #33

A 19-year-old man is reviewed prior to discharge. He presented with vomiting and abdominal pain and was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis. He was managed as an inpatient for five days before being well enough for discharge. He is also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus on this admission as a cause of the diabetic ketoacidosis. He has been educated by the diabetic nurse on how to manage his diabetes and insulin at home, but he is concerned about what his target plasma glucose should be after eating.

What is the recommended target after eating to be achieved by home monitoring?

- a) 3-6mmol/litr
- b) 5-10mmol/litre
- c) 5-9mmol/litre
- d) 7-12mmol/litre
- e) 2-9 mmol/litre

Correct answer is c.

The correct answer is 5-9mmol/litre. NICE recommends that people with type 1 diabetes should aim for 5-7mmol/litre on waking, 4-7mmol/litre before meals and 5-9mmol/litre 90 minutes after eating. Frequent testing is very important in patients starting with insulin therapy to avoid both high and low sugar levels.

## Question #34

An 89-year-old woman is reviewed in the frailty clinic.

She was recently admitted under the care of the elderly team with an episode of delirium, which was triggered by a variety of factors, including a change in housing and constipation.

A course of trimethoprim was prescribed during this admission for a suspected UTI on the basis of urinary urgency but a subsequent urine specimen showed no growth.

You take a detailed history now that she has recovered from her delirium and you strongly suspect she is suffering from urge incontinence, which significantly impacts her quality of life.

She has previously undergone a period of bladder training for this, but given her

symptoms persist, you are keen to start the patient on medication to improve her urge incontinence.

What is the most appropriate medication to use in this case?

- a) Darifenacin

- b) Duloxetine

- c) Mirabegron

- d) Oxybutynin

- e) Tolterodine

Correct answer is c.

Anticholinergics for urge incontinence are associated with confusion in elderly people - mirabegron is a preferable alternative

Urge incontinence can generally be managed with bladder training, but if this is unsuccessful, a trial of medication is recommended in the NICE guidelines.

The correct answer, in this case, is mirabegron . Although anticholinergic drugs are first-line, this is recommended as an acceptable alternative when they are contra- indicated.

Anticholinergic drugs (such as darifenacin, oxybutynin and tolterodine ) are first line, but there are some safety concerns, particularly in elderly patients at risk of delirium. This makes these options incorrect choices for this patient, who has been admitted recently with delirium.

Duloxetine is incorrect. It is not used in the management of urge incontinence but is a second-line treatment for stress incontinence when other measures have failed.

A 56-year-old man is referred to clinic by his General Practitioner as his GP had performed some routine blood tests which showed a K+ of 2.8 mmol/l. The patient feels well in himself. His past medical history includes angina and renal stones. On examination his chest is clear and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Observations are as follows: temperature 36.3, blood pressure 132/86 mmHg, heart rate 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, saturations 95% on air

His ECG shows normal sinus rhythm.

Investigations are as follows:

| Na+         | 142 mmol/l             |
|-------------|------------------------|
| K+          | 2.8 mmol/l             |
| Creat       | 117 µmol/l             |
| Urea        | 9.6 mmol/l             |
| Urinary K+  | 26 mmol/l (normal <20) |
| PaO2        | 11.2 kPa               |
| PaCO2       | 3.6 kPa                |
| pH          | 7.32                   |
| HC03-       | 18 mmol/l              |
| Base excess | -3 mmol/l              |

What is the most likely cause of his hypokalaemia?

- a) Barter's Syndrome
- b) Liddle's Syndrome
- c) Renal tubular acidosis type 1
- d) Renal tubular acidosis type 2
- e) Renal tubular acidosis type 4

Correct answer is c.

All of these diagnoses could cause hypokalaemia except renal tubular acidosis type 4 which causes a hyperkalaemia.

When faced with a patient with hypokalaemia first check the urinary K+, if this is low you should consider gastrointestinal losses such as diarrhoea or vomiting or decreased intake of K+. If the urinary K+ is high check the blood pressure, which is this case is normal. Liddle's Syndrome would cause hypertension.

If the patient is not hypertensive check the bicarbonate if it is low such as in this case the diagnosis is renal tubular acidosis. The clue here is that the patient has a history of renal stones meaning that the diagnosis is renal tubular acidosis type 1.

Renal tubular acidosis type 2 is associated with conditions such as Wilson's disease, lead poisoning and myeloma.

## Question #36

You are reviewing a 57 year-old gentleman in the diabetes outpatient clinic. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is currently taking metformin 850mg three times a day and gliclazide 80mg once daily.

On further questioning he admits having frequent hypoglycaemic episodes at night that distress him as he lives alone. His BMI is calculated at 30.3 kg/m², HbA1c 7.8% (62 mmol/mol) and his co-morbidities include congestive cardiac failure.

How would you change his diabetic treatment?

- a) Stop gliclazide, start insulin
- b) Add exenatide
- c) Add sitagliptin to current regimen
- d) Stop gliclazide, start pioglitazone
- e) Stop gliclazide, start sitagliptin

Correct answer is e.

The NICE guidance on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus:

-  This gentleman has been started on metformin and a sulphonyurea as first line therapy.
-  He is having frequent hypoglycaemic episodes secondary to his sulphonylurea and yet control remains poor, HbA1c 7.8% (62 mmol/mol)
-  Pioglitazone is contraindicated due to his congestive cardiac failure.
-  A DPP-4 inhibitor such as sitagliptin would be a sensible option, the sulphonylurea should be stopped to prevent hypoglycaemia.

## Question #37

A 18-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and poor compliance attends hospital with shortness of breath, vomiting and feeling unwell. He is found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and transferred to the high dependency unit. He has recovered well and is asymptomatic for a period but on day 3 of his treatment starts to feel unwell. He is tired and lethargic. His arms and legs ache and there is cramping at times. He walks to the bathroom and his legs collapse beneath him.

On examination, he is alert and has moist mucosa. There are no fasciculations or myoclonus. He has 4/5 power in all muscle groups with retained sensation. His abdomen is soft and his chest clear. A set of observations show that he is

## tachypnoeic at 24 breaths/min.

| Bloods      | admission   | now        |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Na +        | 128 mmol/l  | 133 mmol/l |
| K +         | 6.1 mmol/l  | 4.5 mmol/l |
| Urea        | 9.2 mmol/l  | 5.6 mmol/l |
| Creatinin e | 134 µmol/l  | 87 µmol/l  |
| Glucose     | 27.1mmol/l  | 12mmol/l   |
| Ketones     | 3.1 mmol/l  | 0.2 mmol/l |
| pH          | 7.01        | 7.35       |

What is the likely course of his deterioration?

- a) Anxiety
- b) Hypophosphataemia
- c) Cerebral pontine myelinolysis
- d) Sepsis
- e) Disequilibration syndrome

Correct answer is b.

Recovering DKA are at risk of hypophosphataemia

This gentleman has developed weakness following treatment for DKA. This is unlikely cerebral pontine myelinolysis as the sodium has been corrected by only 5mmol/l in 2-3 days. There are no focal signs suggesting sepsis though it is likely on the differential. Anxiety should only be made once other diagnoses are excluded. Disequilibration syndrome occurs in dialysis patients and is not relevant here. Therefore the answer is hypophosphataemia that often arises as a side effect of insulin with cells forming ATP and taking up free phosphate to achieve this.

## Question #38

A 62-year-old man presents to hospital with a three day history of tiredness, muscle aches, a fever and pain at the front of his neck. Two weeks ago he had an upper respiratory tract infection which he treated himself with paracetamol and oral decongestants. He did not receive any antibiotics. His only past medical history is mild arthritis of the right knee and he only takes occasional antihistamines during summer time.

On examination, he appears anxious with a fine resting tremor. He has a temperature 38.1°C, a pulse rate of 125 per minute which is regular and normal in character and a blood pressure of 131/78 mmHg. Heart sounds 1 and 2 were present with no added sounds and his chest was clear on auscultation. His abdomen was soft and non-tender with no organomegaly. Neurological examination was unremarkable apart from the resting tremor. Neck examination reveals a diffusely enlarged and tender thyroid gland.

Blood tests are requested and the results are as follows:

Hb

14.0 g/dl

Platelets

378 * 10 9 /l

WBC

8.9 * 10 9 /l

ESR (Westergren)

94 mm/1st hour

Normal range 0-30

Free T4

214 nmol/l

Free T3

192 nmol/L

Plasma TSH

&lt;0.05 mU/l

Which of the following investigations is likely to be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis?

- a) Blood cultures
- b) Serum anti-thyroid antibodies
- c) Ultrasound scan of neck
- d) Radioactive iodine uptake scan
- e) Fine needle aspiration

Correct answer is d.

In De Quervain's thyroiditis there is globally reduced uptake of iodine-131 during thyroid scintigraphy

The patients presenting symptoms and signs are typical of a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, of which the most likely cause of this is De Quervains thyroiditis.

Radioactive iodine uptake scan is the most suitable investigation for confirming subacute thyroiditis which demonstrates reduced intake.

## Question #39

A 68-year-old Indian patient presents to the emergency department with facial tetany, muscle cramps and paraesthesia of her fingers and toes. This is her second admission with similar symptoms. Her past medical history includes diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis with gastrointestinal, cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations. She was also diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency two years ago and receives regular vitamin D supplements. Her blood tests are as follows:

| Hb                | 124 g/l                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| WBC               | 8.0 * 10 9 /l                    |
| Na +              | 141 mmol/l                       |
| K +               | 4.3 mmol/l                       |
| Urea              | 6.5 mmol/l                       |
| Creatinine        | 90 µmol/l                        |
| CRP               | 15 mg/l                          |
| Corrected calcium | 1.68 mmol/l                      |
| Phosphate         | 1.4 mmol/l                       |
| Magnesium         | 0.28 mmol/l                      |
| PTH               | 2 pmol/L (normal range = 8.5-12) |
| Amylase           | 14 u/l                           |

Her symptoms improve with intravenous calcium replacement and intravenous magnesium replacement, correcting both electrolytes to within normal range. What is the underlying cause for these metabolic disturbances in this patient?

- a) Hypomagnesaemia
- b) Primary hypoparathyroidism
- c) Insufficient vitamin D supplementation
- d) Chronic kidney failure
- e) Chronic pancreatitis

Correct answer is a.

## Magnesium deficiency causes hypocalcaemia

This complex picture investigates the underlying cause of hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia in a patient with significant GI disease. With regular vitamin D supplementation, it is unlikely this is the cause. Her renal function is also within normal range. Although her parathyroid hormone levels are low, the likely underlying cause is due to insufficient magnesium absorption due to GI systemic sclerosis, which results in reduces parathyroid hormone release. There is nothing in the history to suggest a primary hypoparathyroidism or chronic pancreatitis.

## Question #40

A 50-year-old man who drives a heavy goods vehicle comes to the diabetes clinic for review. Current medication for diabetes includes metformin 1g BD and gliclazide 160mg BD. His blood sugars have steadily increased over the past few months and his most recent HbA1c is 72 mmol/mol. He has increased in weight by 5kg over the past 12 weeks which he puts down to work, (driving his lorry for excessive periods). On examination his blood pressure is 155/88 mmHg, pulse is 75 beats per minute and regular. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, body mass index is 37 kg/m².

## Investigations:

Na +

140 mmol/l

K +

5.0 mmol/l

Urea

7.1 mmol/l

Creatinin

e

110 µmol/l

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

- a) Add basal insulin
- b) Add mixed insulin
- c) Add pioglitazone
- d) Switch gliclazide to linagliptin
- e) Switch gliclazide to liraglutide

Correct answer is e.

A number of factors come into play with respect to management of this patient's blood glucose. His occupation as a lorry driver precludes medication which may significantly increase his risk of hypoglycaemia. This effectively rules out insulin initiation unless he is prepared to accept any impact on his job. Insulin would also promote further weight gain and salt and water retention, and is therefore less desirable as an option. Pioglitazone promotes weight gain and fluid retention, so again is not really an option.

This leaves us with the two switching scenarios. Switching to liraglutide is preferred, because in trials GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to reduce HbA1c by similar levels to basal insulin, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, and promote approximately 3% weight loss over a 6 month period. DPPIV inhibitors such as linagliptin are potentially less effective in reducing HbA1c than sulphonylureas and linagliptin is therefore not an option here.

## Question #41

A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with vomiting and abdominal pain. He has been becoming worse over four days since eating a barbecued piece of chicken he suspects was undercooked. Since then he has had diarrhoea and vomiting and has recently been noticing abdominal pain. His wife brought him to the emergency department as she felt he was starting to become drowsy. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, steatohepatitis and stable angina. He normally takes metformin, dapagliflozin, aspirin, omeprazole, paracetamol and bisoprolol. Investigations reveal that he has a serum glucose of 12.1 mmol/L, a pH of 6.9 and urine testing reveal +++ of ketones. He is diagnosed with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis. What factor has most likely contributed to the development of diabetic ketoacidosis?

- a) Drug history of dapagliflozin
- b) Drug history of metformin
- c) Drug history of bisoprolol
- d) Medical history of steatohepatitis
- e) Medical history of angina

Correct answer is a.

SGLT2 inhibitors can cause normoglycaemic ketosis in type 2 diabetes

The most likely explanation is the drug history of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor which reduces glucose reabsorption in the urine and increases urinary glucose excretion. This patient has developed one of the side effects of dapagliflozin; DKA. DKA secondary to SGLT2 dapagliflozin is more likely to be euglycaemic than DKA in general. Metformin is associated with metabolic acidosis, especially in the context of reduced renal function or alcohol, and bisoprolol can cause hypoglycaemia. Steatohepatitis can eventually result in hepatic failure causing impaired gluconeogenesis, but this is more likely to result in hypoglycaemia rather than DKA. Angina is unlikely to be relevant.

## Question #42

A 23-year-old man with type 1 diabetes presents to the emergency department with vomiting and abdominal pain. He has been suffering from diarrhea for two days and then became severely dehydrated and started to vomit. He has not had his insulin for the last 24 hours. He normally has a basal bolus regime with Levemir as a long-acting insulin, and Humalog as short-acting. He has no other medical problems or regular prescription. On admission he is found to have acidosis, elevated serum ketones and elevated blood glucose, and was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis. He is given rapid fluid infusion. What insulin should he

## be prescribed?

- a) Fixed rate IV insulin only
- b) Fixed rate IV insulin as well as long-acting insulin
- c) Fixed rate IV insulin, long-acting insulin and short-acting insulin
- d) Sliding scale IV insulin only
- e) Sliding scale IV insulin as well as long-acting insulin

Correct answer is b.

In the acute management of DKA, insulin should be fixed rate whilst continuing re

This is a typical presentation for diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with type 1 diabetes and requires urgent management which should be supported by local guidelines. It is important that IV insulin is started, but any long-acting insulin, Levemir for this patient, should also be continued. This will aid transition back to normal when the DKA resolves and the patient starts to eat and drink again. Giving him short acting insulin is not appropriate during IV insulin therapy which is also a short-acting insulin. Sliding scale IV insulin is no longer recommended in favour of fixed rate insulin.

## Question #43

An 18-year-old woman is brought into the hospital at midnight with generalised weakness and mild difficulty breathing.

On examination, there is weakness in the upper and lower limbs with proximal predominance. Reflexes in the upper limbs are reduced. Muscle tone is normal. Chest sounds clear but expansion is reduced bilaterally. GCS is 15/15.

The patient describes similar episodes in the past that have lasted for only minutes, the episodes decreased in frequency after commencing a ketogenic diet. They had been attributed to hemiplegic migraines, though she had had bilateral symptoms.

From the following options, what investigation will be most helpful in confirming

## the likely diagnosis?

- a) CT head
- b) Electromyography
- c) Lumbar puncture
- d) MRI brain and spinal cord
- e) Urea &amp; electrolytes

Episodes of weakness, hypokalaemia, symptoms triggered by carbohydrate meals → hypokalaemic periodic paralysis

The most likely diagnosis is a periodic paralysis of which hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is the most common. Attacks can be precipitated by high-carbohydrate meals which explains why the number of episodes reduced for this patient when she commenced on a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet.

Differentials might include myasthenia gravis (though this is commonly associated with fatigable weakness rather than 'attacks'), metabolic myopathies (which involve weakness typically worsened by exercise), or in a first attack Guillain-Barre, transverse myelitis, of infective paralysis (tick paralysis, botulism) may be considered.

Urea and electrolytes is the correct answer. A low potassium level would make the diagnosis here clearer. Average potassium levels in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are around 2.4mmol/L. If hypokalaemia is significantly low, less than 2.0mmol/L for example, you should think about secondary causes of hypokalaemia such as losses from the gut, and renal losses.

MRI brain and spinal cord is incorrect. This would be a reasonable investigation to investigate the possibility of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, the pattern of weakness does not fit a particular cerebral or spinal territory which you would expect with MS.

Electromyography is incorrect. Although this would be able to demonstrate myopathy during an acute attack, it would not assist us in determining the specific underlying diagnosis as there are many causes of myopathy.

Lumbar puncture is incorrect. A lumbar puncture would be helpful in looking for inflammatory or infective causes of neurological symptoms, but would not be able to confirm a diagnosis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Given the episodic nature of the attacks, transverse myelitis or infection, for example, would not explain the symptoms here.

CT head is incorrect. This patient's symptoms are recurrent and do not correspond to a particular cerebral territory. A CT head would be unhelpful in confirming the likely diagnosis.

## Question #44

A 51-year-old lady librarian attends outpatient clinic with painful eyes. She reports that her vision has deteriorated over the past four weeks. On examination, she has proptosis, periorbital oedema and a painful complex ophthalmoplegia. She appears anxious and is worried about not coping at work. At present she smokes ten cigarettes daily.

What would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?

- a) IV methylprednisolone
- b) Surgical decompression
- c) Smoking cessation advice
- d) Total thyroidectomy
- e) Artificial tear drops

Correct answer is a.

IV methylprednisolone is the treatment of choice for moderately severe active Graves' ophthalmopathy. IV steroids have fewer side effects than oral steroids. If symptoms or vision do not improve then urgent surgical decompression should be considered.

Artificial tear drops are useful for symptomatic relief.

Total thyroidectomy has shown no benefit in the treatment of thyroid eye disease.

Outcomes have been shown to be worse in those patients who smoke, therefore smoking cessation advice should be given.

## Question #45

A 43-year-old female presents with neck discomfort worsening over the past 2 months. She has no other past medical or family history. Examination reveals a firm neck lump moving with swallowing but not with tongue protrusion. Subsequent ultrasound of her neck with fine needle aspirate reveals a 2.5cm papillary thyroid carcinoma. A CT neck reveals one single lymph node in her left anterior cervical chain. What is the optimum treatment?

- a) Thyroidectomy and neck dissection with postoperative radioiodine ablation
- b) Thyroidectomy and neck dissection without postoperative radioiodine ablation
- c) Lobectomy and neck dissection with postoperative radioiodine ablation
- d) Lobectomy and neck dissection without postoperative radioiodine ablation
- e) Monitor annually

Correct answer is a.

Diagnosis of thyroid tumours are frequently made after the patient has selfpalpated a neck lump or after an incidental finding following unrelated neck imaging. Most prevalent in young females, diagnosis is clinched on fine needle aspiration. The key considerations for treatment are the size of the thyroid mass and the presence of lymph node involvement: any lump greater than 1cm in size or has any signs of metastatic spread should undergo thyroidectomy instead of a lobectomy. The postoperative use of concurrent radioiodine ablation enhances survival benefits in patients at high risk of disease recurrence and is recommended by both the American Thyroid association and a European consensus group. Patients with thyroid lumps greater than 4cm in diameter regardless of extrathyroid disease; those with lumps between 1 and 4cm in diameter and extra-thyroid disease; and all with high-risk histology such as aggressive histological subtypes benefit from radioiodine ablation. In the case of this patient with a 2.5cm mass and lymph node involvement, thyroidectomy, lymph node clearance with neck dissection and postoperative radioiodine ablation is appropriate. Annual monitoring is thus an unsafe option.

## Question #46

A 53-year-old woman comes for review in the general medical clinic. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus six months ago after having developed fatigue and polyuria. She also has hypothyroidism but no other comorbidities. She was started on metformin 500mg twice daily struggled to cope due to gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhoea. What is the most appropriate action?

- a) Reduce to metformin 500mg once daily
- b) Change to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor
- c) Trial of modified release metformin9
- d) Change to sulfonylurea
- e) Change to pioglitazone

Correct answer is c.

The correct answer trial of modified release metformin. NICE guidelines advise to offer standard release metformin as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and to gradually increase the dose to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. If gastrointestinal side effects are not tolerated, then a trial of modified release metformin would be appropriate. If metformin is not tolerated at all then a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea or pioglitazone would be indicated.

## Question #47

A 22-year-old female presents with nausea. She states that it has been going on for approximately 10 weeks. On systemic enquiry she also complains of constipation and fatigue. She has no past medical history and takes no regular medicines.

## Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 110 g/l       | Na +       | 142 mmol/l   |
|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets | 422 * 10 9 /l | K +        | 3.8 mmol/l   |
| WBC       | 8.2 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 6.2 mmol/l   |
| Neuts     | 5.8 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine | 52 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs    | 2.8 * 10 9 /l | CRP        | 4 mg/l       |

Thyroid function tests are also performed:

| TSH      | 2.2 mIU/L (normal 0.4 - 4.0)   |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Total T3 | 3.9 nmol/l (normal 1.1-2.7)    |
| Total T4 | 190 nmol/l (normal 60-160)     |
| Free T3  | 3.6 pmol/l (normal 1.2 - 8.2)  |
| Free T4  | 16 nmol/l (normal 11.7-31.2)   |

What investigation will you perform next?

- a) Thyroid ultrasound
- b) Thyroid peroxidase antibody levels
- c) Thyroglobulin levels
- d) Pituitary function tests
- e) Pregnancy test

Correct answer is e.

Raised total T3 and T4 but normal fT3 and fT4 suggest high concentrations of thyroid binding globulin, which can be seen during pregnancy

The patient has raised total T3 and T4 but normal fT3 and fT4 suggest high concentrations of thyroid binding globulin. This pattern of results is commonly seen during pregnancy. Her symptoms could be attributed to hypothyroidism, however equally they are common symptoms in pregnancy. She is a female of child rearing age and therefore a pregnancy test should be performed.

Thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin levels should be measures in suspected autoimmune hypothyroidism. The normal TSH, fT3 and fT4 makes autoimmune hypothyroidism very unlikely.

There is nothing biochemically or clinically to suggest pituitary disease.

A thyroid ultrasound would be indicated in the presence of a thyroid nodule.

## Question #48

You are asked to review a 55-year-old male surgical for the fourth time in seven days with persistent hyperkalaemia on his blood tests. He has been admitted for 5 weeks under the surgeons following AP resection of sigmoid carcinoma complicated by a superficial wound infection requiring a vacuum dressing. In all of the previous three medical reviews, the patient presented with a serum potassium of greater than 6.5 mmol/l and was treated with insulin-dextrose and calcium gluconate.

His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and neuromyelitis optica diagnosed 6 years ago and stable on the last review 2 months ago. His regular medications include gliclazide 80mg BD, Lantus (insulin glargine) 15 units OD, prednisolone 15 mg OD and baclofen 10mg QDS. During this review, he is alert and comfortable, blood pressure measures

135/82 mmHg, heart rate 90/min and sinus.

His blood tests are as follows:

| Hb         | 121 g/l       |

A repeat CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrates appropriate wounding healing with no local collections at the resection site. No other abdominal pathology is noted.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- b) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- c) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome
- e) Addisonian crisis

## Correct answer is c.

Refractory hyperkalaemia in a patient with a prolonged illness should raise suspicions for adrenal insufficiency. Note that mineralocorticoid deficiency can occur with hyperkalaemia alone without hyponatraemia. In this case, the serum demonstrates a metabolic acidosis with normal bicarbonate and urinary pH greater than 5.5, ruling out type 1 and 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). WaterhouseFriedrichsen syndrome is caused by adrenal haemorrhage, classically secondary to tuberculosis or meningococcal infection, which if present, should be visualised on CT imaging. He does not demonstrate circulatory collapse, abdominal pain or nausea suggestive of Addisonian crisis. Type 4 RTA, causing a failure of the sodium-potassium antiporter is thus the most appropriate diagnosis, in the context of a patient with chronic steroid use and hence predisposition for adrenal insufficiency during acute severe illness.

## Question #49

A 40-year-old woman presents to the ambulatory clinic with a 4-day history of lethargy and weakness. There is also a history of intermittent cramps, particularly when trying to use her hands. She reports having had a recent gastrointestinal infection prior to the onset of her symptoms and has only just begun to eat and drink normally. Her past medical history consists of coeliac disease and vitiligo and her regular medications include folic acid and ferrous sulphate.

On examination, her observations are within normal limits. Her cardiorespiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

A set of routine blood tests are requested and an ECG is taken, as shown below:

What is the most appropriate intervention to improve this patient's symptoms?



- a) 0.9% sodium chloride with potassium supplementation
- b) Calcium chlorid
- c) Hartmann's solution
- d) Magnesium sulphate
- e) Sodium bicarbonate

Calcium chloride is correct. This patient has a history of lethargy and muscle cramping along with an ECG that demonstrates a prolonged QT interval. A

combination of these features is highly suspicious for hypocalcaemia. Given the past medical history of coeliac disease, it is quite possibly a malabsorptive cause of hypocalcaemia contributing to this patient's symptoms. In the context of significant hypocalcaemia, intravenous replacement should be given with either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate.

0.9% sodium chloride with potassium supplementation is incorrect. There are no features of hypokalaemia (e.g. U waves) on this patient's ECG.

Hartmann's solution is incorrect. There is nothing to suggest that this patient would benefit from intravenous fluid resuscitation.

Magnesium sulphate is incorrect. This is classically used in the management of Torsades de Pointes. However, it is also commonly given in the treatment of other arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation). Given that this patient has a prolonged QTc interval, and not yet an arrhythmia (such as Torsades de Pointes that is associated with QTc interval prolongation), the priority should be to reduce the QTc interval which is with the administration of intravenous calcium. Furthermore, calcium would also help to improve the patient's physical symptoms.

Sodium bicarbonate is incorrect. This is not indicated in the management of hypocalcaemia or QTc interval prolongation.

## Question #50

A 80-year-old patient was referred to Accident and Emergency after being found unresponsive in his home. He had just completed a course of antibiotics for a chest infection. He had not been seen for the preceding 36 hours. He had a past medical history of hypertension and type two diabetes.

His medication included Metformin, Gliclazide, Humulin M3 insulin twice a day, Ramipril and Bendroflumethiazide.

His initial examination revealed. Blood pressure 104/53, heart rate 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 and oxygen saturations 90% on air. He had inspiratory crackles on his left lower lung zone. He had sunken eyes, capillary refill time of four seconds and no lower limb swelling. GCS 13 out of 15.

## Initial blood tests;

| Hb        | 11.0 g/dL    |
|-----------|--------------|
| WCC       | 21.4 *10^9/l |

The patient was treated with oxygen, intravenous antibiotics for a chest infection and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin. They were treated with the local diabetic ketoacidosis protocol with IV inulin sliding scale and IV fluids 5500ml in 24 hours.

His repeat bloods 12 hours later were;

| Na+     | 132 mmol/l   |
|---------|--------------|
| K+      | 3.9 mmol/l   |
| Ur      | 12 mmol/l    |
| Cr      | 110 µmmol/l  |
| Glucose | 5 mmol/l     |
| HCO3    | 24 mmol/l    |
| Lactate | 1.7 mmol/l   |
| CRP     | 270mg/l      |

The patient developed a grand mal seizure. His Glasgow coma scale remained 10 an hour after the seizure.

## What is the most likely cause of his neurological deterioration?

- a) Hypoglycaemia
- b) Intracranial venous sinus thrombosis
- c) Cerebral oedema9
- d) Sepsis
- e) Renal failure

Correct answer is c.

All the answers are potentially associated with hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma. The current guidance advises treatment initially with normal saline intravenous rehydration. The target reduction in osmolality is 3-8 mosmol/kg an hour. Only if this target is not being met and the glucose level not reducing sufficiently is insulin to be started.

This patient developed cerebral oedema secondary to rapid reduction in serum osmolality.

## Question #51

A 42-year-old lady comes to see you in outpatients. Incidentally, you notice that her TSH was &lt; 0.1 mU/l on a recent blood test requested by the GP. Her only past medical history is thyroid cancer which has been resected and her only medication levothyroxine 100mcg per day.

She is otherwise asymptomatic. What is the best course of action?

- a) Stop levothyroxine
- b) Continue at 100mcg per day
- c) Repeat thyroid function in 6 weeks
- d) Change to liothyronine equivalent dose
- e) Reduce the levothyroxine as she is over treated

Correct answer is b.

As TSH is a growth factor for many thyroid cancers it is routinely suppressed with levothyroxine. TSH and thyroglobulin should be monitored in patients with a history of thyroid cancer and decisions on the level required are usually specialist led.

High and intermediate risk patients should have their TSH suppressed bellow 0.1 mU/l and low-risk patients TSH should be 0.1-0.5 mU/l.

As she is asymptomatic and her TSH is adequately suppressed this lady should be maintained on her current dose pending specialist review.

## Question #52

A 35-year-old woman is reviewed in endocrinology outpatient clinic. She reports a three-month history of headaches, palpitations, mild constipation, and urinary frequency. She is persistently hypertensive despite treatment with the maximum dose of lisinopril, amlodipine, and indapamide.

Her observations are:

-  Respiratory rate: 18/min

- 

- Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

-  Heart rate: 115bpm

- 

- Blood pressure: 187/98mmHg

-  Temperature: 36.2 o C

-  GCS: 15/15

An ECG is performed which shows sinus tachycardia.

A set of blood tests has been performed. The results are as follows:

| Hb        | 140 g/L       | Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Platelets | 387 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)           |
| WBC       | 9.0 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)          |

| Calcium                           | 2.80 mmol/L   | (2.1-2.6)   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Phosphate                         | 1.2 mmol/L    | (0.8-1.4)   |
| Magnesium                         | 0.8 mmol/L    | (0.7-1.0)   |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | 5.0 mU/L      | (0.5-5.5)   |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 12 pmol/L     | (9.0 - 18)  |
| Parathyroid hormone               | 52 pg/mL      | (10 - 55)   |

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate blood pressure treatment?

- a) Atenolol
- b) Bisoprolol
- c) Nicorandil
- d) Phenoxybenzamine
- e) Spironolactone

Correct answer is d.

PH aeochromocytoma - give PH enoxybenzamine before beta-blockers

This patient has symptoms of hypercalcaemia (constipation, urinary frequency), coupled with a mildly raised serum calcium level. The serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is at the upper end of normal - this is suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. This patient has several cardinal symptoms of a phaeochromocytoma (headache, palpitations, hypertension). This patient is also likely to have a phaeochromocytoma, as the combination of primary hyperparathyroidism (secondary to a parathyroid adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia) and a phaeochromocytoma is in keeping with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2A). The patient will require cross-sectional imaging to localise the phaeochromocytoma. Treatment should be initiated in the interim to control symptoms.

Phenoxybenzamine is the correct answer. Alpha-blockers should be initiated firstline. Initiation of beta-blockers before alpha-blockade will cause unopposed stimulation of alpha-receptors, causing vasoconstriction and hypertensive crisis.

Atenolol is the incorrect answer. Atenolol is a beta-blocker and will cause unopposed stimulation of alpha receptors.

Bisoprolol is the incorrect answer. Bisoprolol is another beta-blocker - like atenolol, it can risk causing a hypertensive crisis.

Nicorandil is the incorrect answer. Nicorandil is a treatment option for lowering blood pressure but is not specifically used to treat hypertension secondary to a phaeochromocytoma.

Spironolactone is the incorrect answer. Spironolactone is used to treat hypertension but as above, it is not a targeted treatment for hypertension due to a phaeochromocytoma.

## Question #53

A 37-year-old man is being investigated for a chronic metabolic acidosis. He has an anion gap of 9 mEq/L and your consultant suspects he may have a renal source of his acidaemia.

Which of the following can lead to renal tubular acidosis (type 2)?

- a) Sjogren's syndrome
- b) Wilson's disease
- c) Haemochromatosis
- d) NSAIDs
- e) Nephrocalcinosis

Correct answer is b.

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis may be caused by Fanconi syndrome

The answer is Wilson's disease.

Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a renal cause of a metabolic acidosis. It has 3 main categories:

-  Type 1: Distal (failure of proton secretion)
-  Type 2: Proximal (failure of bicarbonate reabsorption)
-  Type 4: Aldosterone deficiency/insensitivity

Type 3 is a combination of 1 and 2.

Types 1 &amp; 2 are characterised by hypokalaemia and type 4 is characterised by hyperkalaemia. Sjogren's syndrome is one of the classic causes of Type 1 RTA, as well as nephrocalcinosis being both a common cause and consequence of long standing RTA.

NSAIDs lead to aldosterone resistance, causing a Type 4 RTA.

Wilson's disease causes a form of Type 2 RTA called Fanconi syndrome. It can also be caused by other toxic heavy metals (lead &amp; mercury) as well as expired tetracyclines. It leads to proximal loss of protons, phosphate, amino acids and glucose.

Haemochromatosis is a distractor.

## Question #54

A 34-year-old lady with no previous medical history presents to her GP. She has felt anxious and on edge for the past month. She also reports feeling sweaty and developing shakes in her hand that are impairing her work as a teacher. She has occasional abdominal bloating but manages this with herbal tea.

On examination, you notice she is flushed and tremulous but alert. She has no goitre and no rashes across her skin. There is a small mass palpable in the left side of the pelvis that is non tender and there are normal bowel sounds overlying. Her visual fields and cranial nerve exams are normal. A thyroid scintigraphy shows normal uptake. An MRI scan is awaited.

TSH

5.0 mU/L (range 0.4-4.0)

T4

28 pmol/l (range 9-24)

Urine

HCG

negative

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Jod-Basedow phenomenon
- b) Exogenous iodine intake
- c) Pituitary adenoma
- d) Molar pregnanc
- e) Struma ovarii

Correct answer is e.

Ovarian teratomas can produce exogenous TSH

This lady has clear secondary hyperthyroidism. There are no signs of pituitary disease so we have to consider other sources of TSH production. In pregnancy, HCG can act as an agonist at the TSH receptor but the test here is negative. The pelvic mass and TSH rise can be explained by ovarian teratomas that rarely can secrete TSH.

## Question #55

A 22-year-old woman with a history of partial Kallmann syndrome comes to the fertility clinic for review. She got married some 6 months earlier and wants to start a family. She has normal external genitalia and sparse pubic and axillary hair and has a normal body mass index of 23kg/m². Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?

- a) Clomiphene
- b) HCG and FSH then IVF
- c) Metformin
- d) Oestrogen
- e) Referral for adoption

The correct answer is HCG and FSH then IVF. Restoration of ovulation in females with Kallmann syndrome is complex and often requires HCG to drive production of gonadal steroid hormones, FSH to drive ovulation, harvesting of eggs, and IVF. This process is most effective in achieving successful pregnancy.

Clomiphene does induce ovulation and is useful in patients with other conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome. It is however very unlikely to be effective in patients with gonadotrophin failure like Kallmann syndrome. Metformin has previously been used in the management of PCOS. Oestrogen doesn't restore ovulation in patients with Kallmann syndrome but may be considered for patients who don't want to get pregnant. In the event that fertility treatment isn't successful, adoption can be considered.

## Question #56

A 35-year-old makes an urgent appointment in the diabetes clinic. She has had type 1 diabetes since the age of 20 but has controlled this well with insulin. She has no other medical problems and since diagnosed during a hospital admission with diabetic ketoacidosis has had no further hospital admissions or problems. She is concerned because she has fallen pregnant and wants to makes sure that she is not doing anything to harm the foetus. She is not looking to have a termination. She found out after she missed her period one week ago and took two pregnancy tests which were both positive. She had been taking a basal-bolus regime of insulin as well as atorvastatin. She had retinal screening and urine testing nine months ago. Her HbA1c was last measured three months ago at 39mmol/mol. She has been advised to continue with her insulin. She has also stopped the atorvastatin due to concerns about its effects in pregnancy. What is the most appropriate action to avoid complications of diabetes?

- a) Restart atorvastatin
- b) Increase short-acting insulin dose
- c) Advise termination of pregnancy
- d) Refer for retinal screening
- e) Increase basal insulin dose

Correct answer is d.

Patients with diabetes should have increased frequency of retinal screening during pregnancy due to increased risk of retinopathy

The most appropriate plan is to repeat the retinal screening and test the urine. In diabetes, patients should achieve good diabetic control prior to planning for pregnancy. If this has not been achieved, then NICE advises contraception and to offer termination if pregnancy does occur due to increased risks in pregnancy. This patient has good diabetic control as evidenced by the lack of complications and HbA1c. When anticipating pregnancy, contraindicated drugs such as atorvastatin and ACE inhibitors should be stopped. Labetalol is an appropriate option for blood pressure control. The dose of insulin does not automatically need to be adjusted up or down but blood glucose would need close monitoring during pregnancy. It is advised, however, if the patient has not had retinal screening within the last six months to offer this urgently as there can be rapid development of diabetic retinopathy in pregnancy.

## Question #57

A 52 year-old woman presents with a two day history of nausea and fever. On admission she is confused and her husband states that she was recovering from a recent upper respiratory tract infection and sore throat. He also mentions she has previously been experiencing episodes of diarrhoea and palpitations over the last three months.

Examination reveals a temperature of 40.6ºC, pulse rate of 160 beats per minute and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Her pulse is irregularly irregular. Heart sounds 1 and 2 are present with no added sounds, lung fields are clear and her abdomen is soft and none tender, with bowel sounds being present.

Blood tests are taken and reveal:

| Hb         | 13.2 g/dL      |
|------------|----------------|
| Platelets  | 180 * 10 9 /l  |
| WBC        | 10.2 * 10 9 /l |

| Total thyroxine (T4)                | 220 nmol/l  |

What is the most appropriate immediate treatment?

- a) Propylthiouracil, corticosteroids and propranolol
- b) Propylthiouracil and propranolol
- c) Radio-iodine, corticosteroids and propranolol
- d) Propylthiouracil and corticosteroids
- e) Radio-iodine, propranolol and carbimazole

Thyrotoxic storm is treated with beta blockers, propylthiouracil and hydrocortisone

This patient is having a thyrotoxic storm (hyperthyroid crisis) a rare medical emergency that is caused by an exacerbation of hyperthyroidism and characterised by decompensation of one or more organ systems in people with untreated or poorly treated hyperthyroidism. The precipitating cause is most commonly infection, as with this case, although it is important to check for other causes. The patient above is in atrial fibrillation and shows signs of renal impairment due to dehydration. First line treatment for this medical emergency is propylthiouracil, corticosteroids and propranolol, although chlorpromazine can be added for severe anxiety.

## Question #58

A 46-year-old man presents to the Endocrinology clinic after a referral from his GP for asymptomatic hypercalcaemia, which was recently discovered on some routine blood tests. His past medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he is taking amlodipine, ramipril and chlorthalidone.

## Selected investigation results are shown below:

| Na +                | 141 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +                 | 4.4 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Calcium             | 2.85 mmol/L  | (2.2 - 2.6)   |
| Urea                | 6.6 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine          | 98 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| Parathyroid hormone | 5.5 pmol/L   | (1.6 - 6.9)   |

What is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypercalcaemia?

- a) Chlorthalidone use
- b) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia
- c) Hypercalcaemia of malignancy with ectopic parathyroid hormone-related protein secretion
- d) Primary hyperparathyroidism
- e) Secondary hyperparathyroidism

Correct answer is b.

Low urinary calcium in the presence of hypercalcaemia is suggestive of either familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia or thiazide diuretic use

The correct answer is familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia . This patient has hypercalcemia with low urinary calcium, which narrows the diagnosis down to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or thiazide diuretic usage (other causes of hypercalcemia tend to cause elevated urinary calcium). The diagnosis of FHH is clinched by the inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone. This is because, in FHH, loss of function mutations in the CASR calcium-sensing receptor decrease sensitivity to calcium, meaning PTH remains unsuppressed at higher-than-normal serum calcium levels. Hypocalciuria results from a loss of CASR-mediated negative feedback of tubular reabsorption/ excretion of calcium.

Chlorthalidone use is incorrect, as this would give hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia with a suppressed PTH.

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy with ectopic parathyroid hormone-related protein secretion is incorrect. This would classically lead to hypercalciuria. In addition, serum PTH may be suppressed rather than inappropriately normal in this scenario, as the PTHrp peptide is detected by a different assay from the conventional PTH assay.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. Although this could explain the hypercalcaemia and inappropriately normal PTH, this would lead to hypercalciuria rather than hypocalciuria.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. Here, PTH is released in response to hypocalcaemia, often in the context of renal disease. The elevated serum calcium and normal renal function seen in this patient do not support this diagnosis.

## Question #59

A 35-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with a 24-hour history of nausea, vomiting, and increasing lethargy. He has a known diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus but reports non-adherence to his insulin therapy. On examination, he is dehydrated with dry mucous membranes, Kussmaul breathing, and weighs 63 kg. His vital signs are as follows:

-  Blood pressure: 70/45 mmHg

-  Pulse: 116 bpm

- 

- Respiratory rate: 26/min

## Laboratory investigations reveal:

| Hb                   | 140 g/L        | Male: (135-180)   |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Platelets            | 220 * 10 9 /L  | (150 - 400)       |

| Random blood glucose | 18 mmol/L      |                   |
| pH                   | 6.9            | (7.35 - 7.45)     |
| pCO2                 | 2.6 kPa        | (4.5-6.4)         |
| Na +                 | 140 mmol/L     | (135 -145)        |
| K +                  | 4.1 mmol/L     | (3.5-5.0)         |
| Blood ketones        | 3 mmol/L       |                   |
| Bicarbonate          | 9 mmol/L       | (22-29)           |
| Creatinine           | 105 µmol/L     | (55-120)          |

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

- a) IV normal saline, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium
- b) IV normal saline, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium
- c) IV normal saline, 63 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium
- d) IV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium
- e) IV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium

Correct answer is b.

Diabetic ketoacidosis: the IV insulin infusion should be started at 0.1 unit/kg/hour

IV normal saline, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is the correct answer. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterised by metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia, and ketonaemia. Management involves intravenous normal saline for rehydration, insulin therapy at a rate of 6.3 units/h (based on the patient's body weight of 63 kg), and potassium replacement at 40 mmol/L because the patient's serum potassium is within the range of 3.5-5.5 mmol/L.

IV normal saline, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L potassium are incorrect because the appropriate insulin infusion rate should be calculated as 0.1 unit/kg/hour; for a patient weighing 63 kg, this equates to an infusion rate of 6.3 units/hour.

## IV normal saline, 63 units/h insulin infusion, and 40 mmol/L

potassium represents a significant overdose of insulin. The correct dosage should be based on the standard DKA management protocol of administering insulin at a dose of 0.1 unit/kg/hour, resulting in an infusion rate of 6.3 units/hour for this patient.

IV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 5.0 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is not the appropriate choice here as it underestimates the required rate of insulin infusion (should be set at 6.3 units/h instead). Moreover, leukocytosis can occur associated with hyperglycaemia and DKA; thus, it should not automatically prompt antibiotic administration without further evidence suggestive of infection.

IV normal saline, IV antibiotics, 6.3 units/h insulin infusion and 40 mmol/L potassium is incorrect due to the unnecessary inclusion of antibiotics in the treatment regimen. As previously stated, leukocytosis can be associated with both hyperglycaemia and DKA; therefore, it does not justify empirical antibiotic therapy without other clinical indications pointing towards an infectious process.

## Question #60

You are asked to review a 67-year-old man who is currently an inpatient on a surgical ward with new paraesthesia in his fingers. He was admitted for an elective parathyroidectomy three days ago for fairly long standing hyperparathyroidism and subsequent hypercalcaemia. He had a single parathyroid adenoma excised which had been identified on pre-operative MIBI scanning. The procedure was without complications but he is now complaining of a tingling sensation in his fingers that he first noticed about twelve hours ago. He also complains of new severe pain in both of his ankles which is worse when he walks, but also present at rest. The surgical SHO has already arranged x-rays of the patient's ankles and these reveal multiple osteolytic lesions which have been reported as being suspicious for metastatic disease. He is otherwise fit and well and his only regular medications are paracetamol, tramadol and prophylactic dalteparin. His blood tests are as follows.

Adjusted Calcium

1.84 mmol/L

Magnesium

0.7 mmol/L

What is the most likely explanation for his current symptoms?

- a) Metastatic parathyroid cancer
- b) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- c) Hypomagnesaemia
- d) Hungry bone syndrome
- e) Secondary hypoparathyroidism

Hypocalcaemia after parathyroid surgery is relatively common and usually 'benign' and associated with a transient hypoparathyroidism. However, it can sometimes be more marked and give rise to symptoms such as perioral or finger paraesthesia. This state alone would not, however, explain his ankle pain or x-ray findings.

Although hypomagnesaemia may also be present and should be treated, it does not explain the symptoms. Metastatic parathyroid cancer is a possibility given the x-ray findings, but is very uncommon and is less likely given that his hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia was long standing (i.e. indolent). Secondary hyperparathyroidism is the syndrome of appropriately raised parathyroid hormone in response to hypocalcaemia, usually secondary to chronic kidney disease. Secondary hypoparathyroidism describes the normal parathyroid hormone suppression that occurs in hypercalcaemia secondary to non-parathyroid causes, such as malignanc

## Question #61

47-year-old man attended his GP after checking his blood pressure at the local pharmacy. When he had it checked it was 179/102 mmHg. The GP confirmed it was high in the surgery at 186/103 mmHg. He started him on ramipril 2.5mg and titrated up to the dose to 10mg over the next few weeks. His repeat measurements showed consistently high readings so the GP added amlodipine, which had very little effect despite being tolerated at the maximum dose. After failing to get an adequate response with the addition of a third agent the GP referred the patient to the endocrine clinic.

Observations showed a blood pressure of 190/105 mmHg and a heart rate of 98 beats per minute. On examination, the man was thin with a body mass index of 23 kg/m². His apex was diffuse and displaced with normal heart sounds. The chest was clear and abdomen was soft and non-tender with no evidence of masses or renal bruits. He was noted to have a hard, painless nodule over the thyroid gland.

The 24 hour urinary catecholamines were raised and further investigations confirmed phaeochromocytoma. He was treated medically with an alpha blocker then beta blocker whilst awaiting surgery. In this period he had further investigation into the thyroid nodule, which was a cold nodule on radionucleotide scanning.

Which type of thyroid cancer would you expect this to be histologically?

- a) Papillary
- b) Follicular
- c) Anaplastic
- d) Lymphoma
- e) Medullary

Correct answer is e.

This question tests your knowledge of multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN). This patient could have MEN Type IIa or IIb, which both include phaeochromocytoma and medullary thyroid cancer.

Of all thyroid cancers, medullary thyroid cancer accounts for approximately 5% (and of these, 80% will be sporadic rather than associated with MEN).

## Question #62

A 48-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of fatigue, anorexia and nausea. She has also noticed some darkening of the skin on her hands. Prior to this, she was fit and well, with no significant past medical history. She has a strong family history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

On examination, there is some evidence of wasting of the face, and noticeable hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases. Her blood pressure is 105/75 mmHg. Blood tests are taken:

| Na +   | 134 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| K +    | 5.3 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |

| Urea                              | 6.8 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Creatinine                        | 76 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| Calcium                           | 2.43 mmol/L  | (2.1-2.6)     |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 1.2 mU/L     | (0.5-5.5)     |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 13.3 pmol/L  | (9.0 - 18)    |

An initial test is conducted to confirm the likely diagnosis.

Which subsequent test can be performed to distinguish a primary cause from a secondary cause?

- a) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- b) Long Synacthen test
- c) Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- d) Short Synacthen test
- e) Urinary metanephrines

Correct answer is b.

The long Synacthen test can be used to distinguish primary adrenal failure from secondary adrenal failure

The diagnosis here is that of adrenal insufficiency. The history of fatigue, anorexia and nausea points towards this, along with evidence of hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, hypotension, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. A primary failure is known as Addison's disease. To make the initial diagnosis of adrenal failure, a short Synacthen test should be used - cortisol will fail to rise. However, the question is asking specifically how to differentiate primary from secondary adrenal failure, secondary being a failure of the pituitary to make sufficient ACTH. For this, the long Synacthen test should be used - a higher dose is given and then cortisol levels measured over a longer time period. With primary failure, the adrenals will still be unable to produce cortisol, but with secondary failure, the exogenous ACTH will eventually push the adrenals to produce cortisol.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate primary and secondary causes of Cushing's syndrome, not adrenal insufficiency. This would have instead presented with weight gain and hypokalemia, not the other way around.

The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used first-line to make the initial diagnosis of Cushing's. It does not play a role here.

The short Synacthen test is used to initially diagnose adrenal insufficiency. It does not, however, differentiate between primary and secondary causes - the long test does this.

Urinary metanephrines are used to diagnose pheochromocytoma. In this condition, there is increased secretion of catecholamines and patients present with hypertension, headaches, sweating and palpitations.

## Question #63

A 22-year-old woman presents with persistent nausea and vomiting. She is 16 weeks gestation. She has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medicines. Observations are within normal limits.

Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 115 g/L        | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets | 192 * 10 9 /L  | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC       | 10.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |

| Na +       | 138 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +        | 3.5 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea       | 4.2 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine | 56 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| CRP        | 2 mg/L       | (< 5)         |

What treatment is indicated?

- a) Cyclizine
- b) Domperidone
- c) Metoclopramide
- d) Ondansetron
- e) Pyridoxine

Correct answer is a.

Antihistamines are first-line in the management of nausea &amp; vomiting in pregnancy/hyperemesis gravidarum

Cyclizine is correct. The royal college of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) guidelines recommend antihistamines as the first-line agents for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Domperidone is incorrect. This drug is a second-line agent. The risk of extrapyramidal side effects is less compared to metoclopramide.

Metoclopramide is incorrect. This drug is a second-line agent. Metoclopramide can cause extrapyramidal side effects, particularly in young females (&lt;25 years old).

Ondansetron is incorrect. This drug is a second-line agent. The use of ondansetron during the first trimester is associated with a small increased risk of the baby having a cleft lip/palate.

Pyridoxine is incorrect. Pyridoxine can be used in conjunction with doxylamine, however, pyridoxine monotherapy is specifically not recommended in the RCOG guidelines.

## Question #64

A 32-year-old woman presents with recurrent headaches and blurred vision. She is fatigued and has recurrent constipation requiring laxatives. There is a past medical history of hypertension and she is on amlodipine, ramipril and bendroflumethiazide.

On examination, her blood pressure is 178/102 mmHg. Upon fluid balance review, she seems hypervolaemic with bilateral peripheral oedema. She is of slim build and her cranial nerves and neurological examination show no abnormalities. Fundoscopy reveals grade IV hypertensive retinopathy with papilloedema seen.

Her electrocardiogram reveals features of left ventricular hypertrophy. Her urine dip is negative for protein and blood. A CT head reveals no acute bleed.

Blood results are as follows:

| Na +         | 154 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +          | 2.9 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Bicarbonate  | 23 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |
| Aldosteron e | 70 pmol/L    | (100 - 500)   |
| Renin        | 2 mU/L       | (5-50)        |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Bartter's syndrome
- b) Excess salt in diet
- c) Gitelman's syndrome
- d) Liddle syndrome
- e) Renal artery stenosis

Hypernatraemia associated with hypervolaemia can occur due to hypertonic saline, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, excess salt in diet, or hyperaldosteronism

Liddle syndrome is the correct option. This rare autosomal dominant syndrome is due to dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus, leading to the Na channel not being degraded, thus leading to chronic reabsorption of sodium and water in the nephron. This mimics a state of hyperaldosteronism as aldosterone is usually the hormone implicated in inserting the ENaCs into the nephron. Therefore, this patient has a state of hypervolaemic hypernatraemia with chronically high blood pressure creating the end-organ damage to the optic nerve and heart described above.

The feedback loop in the kidneys has meant that both renin and aldosterone are low for her body to attempt to lower the sodium and water retention. This patient is fatigued and constipated due to hypokalaemia. Liddle's is treated with a combination of a low sodium diet and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride).

Liddle's has a classic triad in the textbooks of hypertension, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. However, hypernatraemia is also a feature due to the above processes and this should not be forgotten in the clinical work-up.

Bartter's syndrome is an incorrect option. This is an autosomal recessive syndrome which causes salt-wasting from the kidney and subsequently a state of hyperaldosteronism and usually low blood pressure, not high blood pressure as seen in this case.

Gitelman's syndrome is an incorrect option as it is another autosomal recessive syndrome similar to Bartter's, which causes low blood pressure usually.

Excess salt in the diet is incorrect. Even though it would cause hypernatraemia and chronic excess would cause states of hypertension; you would not find hypokalaemia. Furthermore, it would be a more unlikely cause at the young age of this patient with the anti-hypertensive therapy resistance.

Renal artery stenosis is an incorrect answer because this condition causes difficulty to control hypertension with a high plasma renin activity found, instead of low, as more renin is produced in response to the low pressure sensed by the constricted renal artery. The kidneys think that the blood pressure is systemically low when it is a locally mediated effect from the stenosis.

## Question #65

A 53-year-old female presents with 48 hours of general malaise. 30 years ago, she underwent a resection of a pituitary mass and has since been compliant on desmopressin, levothyroxine and hydrocortisone, up until her last dose earlier in the morning. She has no other past medical history. Her husband reports the patient to have had reduced oral intake for the past 2 days while she has been unwell. She has no reported head injuries, rigors or pyrexia. On examination, her GCS is E3 V2 M5. She is cool peripherally and a temperature demonstrates 33.4 degrees under her tongue. Her spot blood glucose is 2.2 mmol/l. Her blood pressure is 86/50 mmhg heart rate 110/min and sinus rhythm. Blood tests demonstrate a sodium of 158 mmol/l and potassium of 4.2 mmol/l. What is your first action(s)?

- a) Send thyroid function test
- b) Administer IV liothyronine
- c) Send random cortisol
- d) Administer IV hydrocortisone
- e) CT head, blood culture, urine dip, HbA1c

Correct answer is d.

In the context of a sudden decline in any patient with long-term steroid use with hypotension, hypothermia and hypoglycaemia, you must treat presumptively for an Addisonian crisis. It must be remembered while the classic biochemical presentation of hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia is frequently quoted in textbooks, this is frequently not the case in real life. While she may indeed be thyroid deficient, neither thyroid function tests nor intravenous free T3 is the most immediate treatment. A random cortisol, in the context of recent hydrocortisone in the community, is uninterpretable.

## Question #66

A 45-year-old woman develops agitation, high fever, sweating and atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 160bpm following a CT pulmonary angiogram. She was recently seen in the emergency department and given a provisional diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and discharged with an urgent CT pulmonary angiogram and treatment dose low molecular weight heparin two days ago. She has a past medical history of breast cancer which has recently recurred with metastases to the liver, depression and COPD. She normally takes sertraline, letrozole, carbimazole and as needed salbutamol. Her original presentation to the emergency department was with shortness of breath which has now resolved. The CT scan has demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolism and clear lung fields. On examination, she is very agitated, has tremors, is very hot to touch and has ankle oedema. She has bilateral crepitations on chest auscultation. Her temperature is 40.1ºC. Blood tests are pending. What is the most likely cause of her presentation?

- a) Delayed autoimmune reaction secondary to contrast medium
- b) Atypical pneumonia
- c) Missed pulmonary embolism with right heart strain
- d) Thyroid storm
- e) Heparin induced thrombocytopenia

Correct answer is d.

Iodine in CT contrast media can precipitate thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm

The correct answer is thyroid storm. The iodine in the CT contrast medium can trigger thyrotoxicosis and thyroid storm. The features of hyperpyrexia, agitation, confusion, AF with a fast ventricular rate in a patient with known hyperthyroidism following a triggering event, such as CT contrast, infection or surgery can thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm. An autoimmune reaction is unlikely given the absence of rash and presence of fever and agitation. Pneumonia is unlikely without any radiological features on the CT scan and also with the absence of a cough, and missing pulmonary embolism is unlikely, but it is also unlikely to miss right heart strain on CT

## Question #67

A 19-year-old woman comes to the endocrine clinic for review. She has problems with hirsutism and irregular periods, and troublesome weight gain. Her GP has just stressed the need to lose weight and offered no pharmacological intervention. She takes no medication from the doctor and is currently studying law. Examination reveals a blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg, pulse is 65 beats per minute and regular. body mass index is 32kg/m². You confirm extensive hirsutism affecting the beard line, upper lip and the nipples. there is acne over the face and the upper chest. Relevant bloods include:

| testosterone    | 4.8 nmol/l (upper limit of normal 2.1 nmol/l)   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| LH:FSH ratio    | 2.1                                             |
| fasting glucose | 5.0 mmol/l                                      |

Her main concern is hirsutism.

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?

- a) Co-cyprindiol

- b) Clomiphene

- c) Levonorgestrel

- d) Metformin

- e) Pioglitazone

Correct answer is a.

Co-cyprindiol contains both cyproterone, an anti-androgen, and ethinylestradiol, (a synthetic oestrogen). In combination, used for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome, the most likely diagnosis here, co-cyprindiol significantly reduces symptoms of hirsutism and acne, both related to androgen excess.

Clomiphene is the preferred option for inducing ovulation, and is preferred to metformin for this purpose, although the two are sometimes used in combination in the obese population. Pioglitazone is also effective in reducing ovarian insulin resistance, and inducing ovulation, but is not used due to its adverse event profile. Progesterone, (levonorgestrel), is ineffective in managing hirsutism.

## Question #68

A 43-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology outpatient service after a finding of incidental hypercalcaemia on a routine blood test. She has no past medical history.

The examination is unremarkable.

Blood tests:

Parathyroid hormone

7.9 pmol/L

( 1.6 - 6.9)

| Calcium    | 2.74 mmol/L   | (2.20-2.6)   |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Vitamin D  | 75 nmol/L     | (>50)        |
| Urea       | 4.2 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)  |
| Creatinine | 66 µmol/L     | (55 - 120)   |

What is the most likely explanation for the findings from the list below?

- a) Familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia
- b) Multiple myeloma
- c) Sarcoidosis
- d) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- e) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism

Correct answer  is a.

Patients with familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia may have a normal or raised PTH

Familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia is the correct answer. The patient has hypercalcaemia with a raised PTH level. Plausible differentials include primary hyperparathyroidism, tertiary hyperparathyroidism and familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops in patients with longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism (typically as a consequence of CKD, which is absent here). Primary hyperparathyroidism is not listed as an option. Therefore, familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia is the correct answer.

Multiple myeloma is incorrect. Classically, malignancies cause a suppressed PTH level if they are the cause of hypercalcemia. This is true of multiple myeloma.

Sarcoidosis is incorrect. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is due to the uncontrolled production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 by macrophages. This causes hypercalcemia and a suppressed PTH. unlike in some forms of hyperparathyroidism, the negative feedback mechanism whereby high calcium causes a low PTH is maintained.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. This form of hyperparathyroidism occurs as an appropriate reaction to low vitamin D or calcium. In this case, the vitamin is normal and the calcium is high.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops in patients with longstanding secondary hyperparathyroidism (typically as a consequence of CKD, which is absent here). Therefore this is not likely.

## Question #69

A 23-year-old female presents with worsening acne and a marked increase in the development of body and facial hair which she finds very distressing. She is also overweight and is markedly stressed by her physical appearance and the development of stretch marks over her abdomen. She has tried multiple hair removal techniques with only mild success.

On examination, she has a body mass index of 28 kg/m², coarse hair over the anterior and posterior part of her chest and under her chin. Her Blood Pressure is 135/90mmHg.

Her lab results are as follows:

| 9:00 am Cortisol   | 345 nmol/l (170 700 nmol/l)   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| LH                 | 17 iU/l (1 20 iU/l)           |
| Basal FSH          | 7.1 iU/l (1.0 8.8 iU/l)       |

| DHEAS              | 545 µg/dl (31 228 µg/dl)    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Prolactin          | 160 mU/l (<360 mU/l)        |
| 17 OH Progesterone | 1025 ng/dl (<80 ng/dl)      |
| Testosterone       | 3.9 nmol/l (0.9 3.1 nmol/l) |

Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis reveals two cysts in the right ovary.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option for her condition?

- a) Combined oral contraceptive pill
- b) Finasteride
- c) Surgical resection of the ovarian cysts
- d) Reverse circadian rhythm steroids
- e) Metformin in combination with spironolactone

## Correct answer is d.

The diagnosis in this scenario is non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia which manifests in adolescence/adulthood. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21 hydroxylase in the steroid biosynthetic pathway. The result is a shift in the production of steroid hormones towards the androgenic pathway. Since cortisol secretion is reduced, feedback leads to increased ACTH production and resultant hyperplasia of the adrenals. The level of the compounds that are formed prior to the action of 21 hydroxylase is increased, therefore levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone are elevated. Due to excessive androgen production, there is virilization and hirsutism.

Treatment involves steroids given in reverse circadian rhythm, i.e. a higher dosage at night and a lower dose in the morning.

The rationale behind this approach is due to the pathophysiology of CAH. The adrenal hyperplasia and the over-secretion of adrenal androgens are due to excessive ACTH production. When steroids are given in higher doses at night, ACTH is suppressed and the normal physiological steroid peak in the morning is also reduced.

Cysts in the ovaries are a common finding on routine ultrasound and do not necessarily represent polycystic ovarian syndrome.

## Question #70

You are seeing a 50-year-old lady with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the outpatient clinic. She has a past medical history of gastritis, moderate left ventricular dysfunction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She is currently on metformin and gliclazide. Since last review she has gained 5kg in weight and her HbA1c has deteriorated to 70 mmol/mol from 62 mmol/mol. Body mass index today in clinic is 33 kg/m².

Recent blood tests are as follows:

Na +

141 mmol/l

K +

3.9 mmol/l

Urea

6 mmol/l

Creatinin

e

140 µmol/l

She was unable to previously tolerate liraglutide due to nausea and vomiting. What would be the best alteration to her therapy?

- a) Empagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor)
- b) Add insulin
- c) Add pioglitazone
- d) Increase dose of metformin
- e) Increase dose of gliclazide

Correct answer is a.

SGLT inhibitors have the advantage of improving glycaemic control/HbA1c and having beneficial effects on weight. This is because their mode of action is independent of insulin release. They act upon the SGLT-2 receptors in the kidney and lead to increased loss of glucose in the urine.

## Question #71

A 36-year-old woman is reviewed 3 months post-partum. During the pregnancy she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Following the delivery her glycaemic control has failed to improve and she has been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is only slightly overweight (body mass index 27.1 kg/m²) and you are worried about missing maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or type 1 diabetes. Which one of the following is most suggestive of MODY?

- a) Ketosis during periods of hyperglycaemi
- b) Family history of early onset diabetes mellitus
- c) A history of polycystic ovarian syndrome
- d) Lack of response to sulphonylureas
- e) A history of autoimmune disease

Correct answer is b.

MODY is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion so a family history is often present

The correct answer is a family history of early onset diabetes mellitus . Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of monogenic disorders characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually before 25 years of age), and a primary defect in pancreatic beta-cell function. A family history of early onset diabetes mellitus is most suggestive of MODY because it indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition to the condition, which is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern seen in MODY.

Ketosis during periods of hyperglycaemia is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes rather than MODY. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to an absolute insulin deficiency. In the absence of sufficient insulin, the body relies on breaking down fats for energy, resulting in ketone production and ketosis. In contrast, patients with MODY typically have a defect in pancreatic beta-cell function but still produce some insulin, so they are less likely to develop ketosis.

A history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is not particularly suggestive of MODY. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some forms of MODY can be associated with insulin resistance, it would not be considered the most characteristic feature when trying to differentiate between types of diabetes.

Lack of response to sulphonylureas can be seen in some subtypes of MODY (e.g., MODY 1 and MODY 3). However, it does not necessarily rule out other types or subtypes since there are several different genetic defects that can cause MODY. Furthermore, lack of response to sulphonylureas could also occur in type 2 diabetics who have progressed to needing insulin therapy.

A history of autoimmune disease is more suggestive of type 1 diabetes, as it results from an autoimmune process that destroys pancreatic beta cells. While there is no strong association between MODY and autoimmune diseases, a history of autoimmune disease could increase the likelihood of developing other types of diabetes, such as type 1 or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA).

## Question #72

A 40 year old man presents to the Emergency Department with tiredness and dizziness (worse on standing) which has been ongoing for the past few months. He had a past medical history of epilepsy and mentions that he has had 'brain surgery' in the past. He is on some medications but cannot remember the names. He has no allergies.

On assessment, he has no focal neurological deficit and cardiovascular/respiratory examination is normal. Observations show a blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg (dropping to 105/82 mmHg on standing), a heart rate of 67 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.2 degrees, oxygen saturations of 94% on air and a respiratory rate of 18/min. Given his medical history, you opt to keep this gentleman in the short stay unit for observation overnight.

## Baseline blood tests are as follows:

| Hb   | 125 g/l    |
|------|------------|
| WCC  | 9.2 x109/l |
| Plt  | 290 x109/l |
| CRP  | 10 mg/l    |
| Gluc | 3.9 mmol/l |
| Na+  | 138 mmol/l |
| K+   | 5.8 mmol/l |
| Ur   | 7.2 mmol/l |
| Cr   | 100 µmol/l |
| TSH  | 0.4 mU/l   |

T4

Given the above, what is the most likely underlying diagnosis?

- a) Hypopituitarism
- b) Hypothyroidism
- c) Acromegaly
- d) Pheochromocytoma
- e) Medication side effects

Correct answer is a.

This gentleman has hypopituitarism following 'brain surgery'. Though the details of this are obscured in the question, it is likely that removal of a pituitary mass with trans-sphenoidal surgery. This is exhibited by fairly non-descript symptoms coupled with some underlying evidence of lack of anterior pituitary hormones: low BP/dizziness/postural hypotension, high/normal K+, low/normal Na+ and low/normal blood glucose all indicate lack of cortisol due to low ACTH; the low/normal temperature and heart rate and the tiredness steer you towards low thyroxine level due to lack of TSH.

This gentleman needs assessment of his pituitary function. This can be done in many ways. A baseline pituitary hormone profile can be quite useful; however the most definitive tests involve assessing dynamic pituitary function. The insulin stress test (coupled with TRH and GnRH tests) creates a hypoglycaemic effect in the body and the response of the pituitary (cortisol surge) is measured. However, inducing hypoglycaemia in epileptics, such as this gentleman, is contraindicated. Therefore the next best investigation is the glucagon stimulation test which mimics hypoglycaemia in the body and causes a fake stress on the pituitary, therefore being safe to use in epileptics.

A 29-year-old woman comes to the clinic with feelings of anxiety, palpitations and a resting tremor present over the past 2 weeks. She also has symptoms of a flulike illness and pain over her anterior neck. On examination,you reveal tenderness over the thyroid. Her blood pressure is 115/88 mmHg, she has a fine tremor at rest, sweaty palms and a tachycardia of 88 beats per minute. TSH is &lt;0.05 U/ml.

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?

- a) Thyroxine
- b) Carbimazole
- c) Propylthiouracil
- d) Carbimazole and thyroxine
- e) Propranolol

Correct answer is e.

The short history of flu-like symptoms, coupled with pain over the thyroid gland is consistent with a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. The presentation with thyrotoxicosis is caused by a transient increase in thyroid hormone release, rather than over production, hence anti-thyroid drugs are not indicated. Symptomatic relief with propranolol is indicated, as are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for management of pain and inflammation. A period of hypothyroidism may follow, with later recovery to normal thyroid function.

Anti-thyroid drugs are not needed, carbimazole and propylthiouracil are therefore incorrect, as is the block-replace regimen option. Although a transient period of hypothyroidism may be seen after the thyrotoxicosis subsides, thyroxine replacement is usually not needed.

In the long term treatment of his diabetes which hypoglycaemic agent is best avoided?

- a) Metformin
- b) Pioglitazone
- c) Gliclazide
- d) Acarbose
- e) Insulin glargine

Pioglitazone - contraindicated by: heart failure

Answer: Pioglitazone

One of the side effects of pioglitazone is fluid retention, therefore it is best avoided in a patient with a risk of heart failure like the above patient as it can precipitate or worsen heart failure due to fluid overload.

## Question #75

A 45-year-old woman comes to the clinic some 6 months after thyroid resection for differentiated thyroid cancer. She is well, has recovered from her surgery and has a neatly healed scar across her anterior neck. Blood pressure is normal at 110/80 mmHg, and her pulse is 60 and regular. Her body mass index is unchanged at 25 kg/m². Only medication is thyroid hormone replacement.

Which of the following is the most appropriate way to monitor for a recurrence?

- a) MRI neck
- b) Technetium scanning
- c) Thyroglobulin
- d) Thyroid ultrasound scan
- e) T3 levels

Correct answer is c.

Given this patient is prescribed thyroid hormone replacement, monitoring of T3 or T4 is not useful in monitoring for cancer recurrence. On the other hand the presence of thyroglobulin does indicate thyroid gland activity which isn't suppressed by thyroid hormone replacement and is therefore potentially cancerous in origin. Levels should be undetectable.

Radiological investigations such as MRI neck, technetium scanning or thyroid ultrasound scanning are potentially less sensitive than monitoring for thyroglobulin and are therefore not a preferred first line investigation. T3 levels are unsuitable as a marker of recurrence given that conversion of exogenously administered T4 to T3 confounds any measurement.

## Question #76

An 82-year-old man is reviewed on the ward. He was admitted with recurrent falls four days ago. He has been found to have symptomatic postural hypotension with a drop of 50mmHg on standing in systolic blood pressure.He has a past medical history of hypertension, osteoporosis, radial fracture and COPD. He was taking ramipril and amlodipine, as well as inhalers and calcium supplements. He normally has a good functional baseline and is independent.

Despite stopping all antihypertensives on admission the physiotherapists are unable to mobilise him due to worsening of his symptoms on standing. At rest, he has a blood pressure of 150mmHg systolic. What is the most appropriate plan?

- a) Fludrocortisone
- b) Hydrocortisone
- c) Discharge bedbound and continue with physiotherapy at home
- d) Discharge bedbound with restarting antihypertensives
- e) Inpatient rehabilitation

The correct answer is fludrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid with minimal glucocorticoid activity but very high mineralocorticoid activity which can aid in symptomatic postural hypotension and can significantly reduce symptoms. It may take several days to have an effect but can restore mobility in some patients. Continuing with rehabilitation without addressing his treatable cause would not be optimal, whilst re-introducing his antihypertensives would reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease but would also reduce his independence significantly.

## Question #77

A 58-year-old patient who has a history of hypertension is operated on by the neurosurgeons for an intracranial haemorrhage.

Over the next few days his serum sodium level progressively declines and by the third day has fallen to 118 mmol/l despite fluid restriction to 1L per day. Urine osmolarity is 700 mOsmo/l and urinary sodium is raised at 80 mmol/l.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Addisonian crisis
- b) Secretion of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
- c) Cranial diabetes insipidus
- d) Hypovolaemi
- e) Fluid overload

The hyponatraemia and hypotonic blood plasma, coupled with the raised urine osmolality and raised urinary sodium excretion indicates a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. This is a condition that can occur after head trauma, a central nervous system infection and intracranial haemorrhage.

## Question #78

A 46-year-old woman presents with polyuria. She has also noticed a swelling over the front of her neck and has been having headaches, sweating, and palpitations. Observations are as follows: heart rate 115 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/85 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, SpO2 99% (on air), temperature 37.1ºC.

Blood results are as follows:

Calcium

2.9 mmol/L

(2.1-2.6)

| Phosphate                         | 0.6 mmol/L   | (0.8-1.4)   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| PTH                               | 4.8 pmol/L   | (1.6 - 6.9) |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 4.2 mU/L     | (0.5-5.5)   |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 14.2 pmol/L  | (9.0 - 18)  |

What investigation is required?

- a) Radioactive iodine uptake scan
- b) Serum calcitonin
- c) Serum thyroglobulin
- d) Thyroid peroxidase antibodies
- e) Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies

Correct answer is b.

MEN type II: obtain a thyroid ultrasound and serum calcitonin to exclude medullary thyroid cancer

Serum calcitonin is correct. The patient most likely has multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2. The presence of hypercalcemia with an 'inappropriately normal' PTH is suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient also likely has a phaeochromocytoma due to the classic triad of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia. The neck swelling is concerning for medullary thyroid cancer which should be investigated with a thyroid ultrasound and serum calcitonin.

Radioactive iodine uptake scan is incorrect. Medullary thyroid cancer cells do not absorb iodine, and therefore radioiodine scans are not used to diagnose this type of cancer.

Serum thyroglobulin is incorrect. Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer release thyroglobulin which can therefore be used as a tumour marker for these types of cancer. However medullary cell cancer does not produce thyroglobulin. Medullary cell cancer cells produce calcitonin which can therefore be used as a tumour marker.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies is incorrect. The patient is euthyroid and thus investigation for hypothyroidism with thyroid autoantibodies is not required.

Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies is incorrect. The patient is euthyroid and thus investigation for hypothyroidism with thyroid autoantibodies is not required.

## Question #79

A 16-year-old boy presents with several months of generalised weakness and muscle cramps. He also describes polydipsia and cravings for salty foods. He has no significant past medical history.

On examination, he appears generally well in himself. Observations are as follows:

-  Respiratory rate of 18/min
-  Blood pressure of 116/78mmHg
-  Heart rate of 78/min

Blood tests are done and the results are as follows:

| Na +   | 129 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| K +    | 2.8 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |

A urine dipstick shows no glucose or protein present. A urine sample is sent to the lab for further analysis:

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Bartter syndrome
- b) Dent disease
- c) Fanconi syndrome
- d) Gitelman syndrome
- e) Liddle syndrome

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

The syndrome presented here is that of Gitelman syndrome . This is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule. Symptomatic patients present with symptoms identical to those taking excessive thiazide diuretics - hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hyponatraemia. Patients are normotensive. Importantly, patients also display hypocalciuria, which differentiates the condition from Bartter syndrome. Treatment involves salt replacement.

Bartter syndrome is a similar condition, except that it involves a mutation in the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in the loop of Henle. As such, the condition mimics loop diuretic abuse. Whilst also presenting with hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and normotension, the condition crucially presents with hypercalciuria, rather than hypocalciuria as seen in Gitelman syndrome.

Dent disease is a rare X-linked recessive condition that affects the proximal tubules. It is characterised by tubular proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and glycosuria. It is one of the causes of Fanconi syndrome. The scenario above is more closely aligned with Gitelman syndrome.

Fanconi syndrome is a syndrome of proximal tubule dysfunction. It presents with polyuria and polydipsia, like in this scenario, but patients would also have proteinuria and glycosuria, unlike the patient here. Hypokalaemia would also be noted, as well as hypophosphataemia. It may be genetic, such as being caused by Dent disease or acquired.

Liddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition - a mutation in the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) of the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The condition causes hypertension, which does not respond to medications, and hypokalaemia. Typically, children are asymptomatic at presentation. The patient in this scenario is normotensive

## Question #80

A 65-year-old retired nurse was referred to the endocrine clinic by her primary care physician in view of incidentally-detected hypercalcaemia. She had no significant past medical history and was not taking any regular medications. Her general physical and systemic examination was unremarkable.

Which one of the following investigations is most likely to help establish the diagnosis?

- a) 1,25-OH vitamin D levels
- b) PTH level
- c) 25-OH vitamin D levels
- d) Myeloma screen
- e) Sestamibi scan

Correct answer is b.

Measuring PTH level is the first step in investigating hypercalcaemia

The most likely cause of hypercalcaemia in this case is primary hyperparathyroidism. The annual incidence is approximately 1 in 1000 and is commonly seen in post-menopausal women. The underlying aetiology of primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroid adenoma (80-85%) followed by parathyroid hyperplasia (~10-14%). Measuring PTH level is the first step in investigating hypercalcaemia.

## Question #81

You order an oral glucose tolerance test which is as follows:

| Time (mins)            |   0 |   30 |   60 |   90 |   120 |
|------------------------|-----|------|------|------|-------|
| Growth hormone (ng/ml) | 2.2 |  2.4 |  3.1 |  3.6 |   3.7 |

Given the likely diagnosis, what other investigation will be required in the future?

- a) Transesophageal echocardiography
- b) Colonoscopy
- c) Flexible sigmoidoscopy
- d) CT colonography
- e) No further investigations required

Correct answer is b.

Patients with acromegaly should be offered regular colonoscopic screening, starting at the age of 40 years. The frequency of repeat colonoscopy should depend on the findings at the original screening and the activity of the underlying acromegaly

The clinical features and results of the oral glucose tolerance test confirm a diagnosis of acromegaly. In normal a rise in glucose should cause suppression of growth hormone (GH) to undetectable values.

Cardiovascular disease is highly prevalent in Acromegaly due to a combination of risk factors associated with this disease, in particular, secondary diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Patients should therefore be screened for cardiovascular risk factors and these should be managed aggressively. A transthoracic echo would be prudent to perform, however transesophageal echocardiography is unnecessary.

Patients with acromegaly have high levels of insulin like growth factor which predisposes to malignancy, in particularly colorectal carcinoma. Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and CT colonography can all be used to screen for colorectal carcinoma, however colonoscopy is the most sensitive test making this the best answer.

Patients with acromegaly should be offered regular colonoscopic screening, starting at the age of 40 years. The frequency of repeat colonoscopy should depend on the findings at the original screening and the activity of the underlying acromegaly.

## Question #82

A 45-year-old female presents to the clinic with right sided flank pain. A CT KUB confirms a right sided kidney stone. She has a past medical history of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. Her drug history includes salbutamol, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine.

Blood results are as follows:

| Hb           | 115 g/l                 | Na +       | 136 mmol/l   |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets    | 460 * 10 9 /l           | K +        | 3.1 mmol/l   |
| Bicarbonat e | 16 mEq/L (normal 22-28) | Urea       | 7.8 mmol/l   |
| Chloride     | 115mmol/l               | Creatinine | 76 µmol/l    |

How would you prevent further kidney stones?

- a) Thiazide diuretics
- b) Loop diuretics
- c) Penicillamine
- d) Encourage increased fluid intake
- e) Sodium bicarbonate3

Correct answer is e.

Treatment of RTA involves correction of the acidaemia with oral sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or potassium citrate

The patient has a low bicarbonate which confirms a metabolic acidosis. This should prompt you to work out the anion gap which can be extremely useful diagnostically.

The anion gap in this example = sum of positive cations - sum of negative anions = (Na + K) - (HCO3 + Cl) = 9.1 We are therefore dealing with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).

High anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) is generally caused by the following conditions which can be remembered with the mnemonic KULT

-  Ketoacidosis: diabetic, starvation or alcoholic
-  Uraemia
-  Lactic acidosis
-  Toxins e.g. salicylates, ethylene glycol, methanol

Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) is generally caused by the following conditions which can be remembered with the mnemonic ABCD

-  Addison's disease
-  Bicarbonate loss via GI tract (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal tract (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)
-  Chloride excess - hyperchloraemic acidosis
-  Drugs e.g. acetazolamide

In this case, the NAGMA, hypokalaemia, and renal stones should prompt you to consider renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The presence of kidney stones, and the past medical history of Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis make RTA type 1 (distal) the most likely diagnosis. Treatment of RTA involves correction of the acidaemia with oral sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or potassium citrate.

## Question #83

A 72-year-old Japanese female presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath associated with palpitations. She has previously experienced similar palpitations 6 months ago but did not seek medical attention. She was last completely well and described by her daughter to be at baseline 24 hours ago when they had dinner together. The patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting or sweating. On examination, the patient is pyrexic at 38.2 degrees and tachycardic, with a regular pulse at 130-140 beats per minute. Heart sounds demonstrate a gallop rhythm; auscultation of her chest reveals bibasal inspiratory coarse crackles and no wheeze. She has bilateral mild lower limb pitting oedema to low ankles. Examination of the abdominal and neurological systems is unremarkable. A chest radiograph demonstrates bibasal alveolar shadowing with mild bilateral pleural effusions. An ECG demonstrates sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute. Blood tests are as follows:

| Hb         | 123 g/l       |
|------------|---------------|
| Platelet s | 299 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC        | 9.5 * 10 9 /l |

Nursing staff have kindly taken blood cultures and taken measures to cool the patient. What is the next most appropriate immediate treatment?

- a) Intravenous propranolol
- b) Lugol's iodine
- c) Oral carbimazole
- d) Oral propylthiouracil
- e) Oral prednisolone

Correct anwer is a.

In thyroid storm with IV beta-blockers are a important first-line treatment

The patient has presented with sudden onset heart failure associated with sinus tachycardia, pyrexia and thyrotoxicosis: this represents a thyroid storm and is an endocrinological emergency. The treatment comprises of four aims: resuscitation, treat the sympathetic consequences of thyrotoxicosis, block underlying hyperthyroidism and treat any heart failure present. The first step involved intravenous followed by oral beta-blockade. Diltiazem is an appropriate alternative if the patient cannot tolerate beta blockers. In cases of simultaneous poor ventricular function and thyroid storm, intravenous infusions of short-acting beta blockers such as esmolol are also appropriate, which can be switched off immediately at the earliest sign of worsening cardiac function secondary to beta blockade. Thyroid blockers can be instituted after this immediate therapy. Oral corticosteroids are also important to reduce peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. However, both treatments can be instituted after achieving haemodynamic stability.

## Question #84

A 48-year-old man who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents for review. During his annual review he was noted to have the following results:

| Total cholesterol   | 5.3 mmol/l   |
|---------------------|--------------|
| HDL cholesterol     | 1.0 mmol/l   |
| LDL cholesterol     | 3.1 mmol/l   |
| Triglyceride        | 1.7 mmol/l   |
| HbA1c               | 6.4%         |

A QRISK2 score is calculated showing that he has a 12% 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. His current medication is metformin 500mg tds. According to recent NICE guidelines, what is the most appropriate action?

- a) Simvastatin 40mg on
- b) Lifestyle advice, repeat lipid profile in 3 months
- c) Atorvastatin 40mg on
- d) Atorvastatin 20mg on
- e) Increase his metformin slowly to 1g tds

Correct answer is d.

NICE recommend the following when considering the use of statins in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:

## Question #85

A 64-year-old man is reviewed in clinic. He has a history of ischaemic heart disease and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus around 12 months ago. At this time of diagnosis his HbA1c was 7.6% (60 mmol/mol) and he was started on metformin which was titrated up to a dose of 1g bd. The most recent bloods show a HbA1c of 6.8% (51 mmol/mol). He has just retired from working in the IT industry and his body mass index (BMI) today is 28 kg/m². His other medication is as follows:

Atorvastatin 80mg on Aspirin 75mg od Bisoprolol 2.5 mg od Ramipril 5mg od

What is the most appropriate next step?

- a) Add sitagliptin
- b) Make no changes to his medication
- c) Add empagliflozin
- d) Add pioglitazone
- e) Add exenatide

Correct answer is c.

Normally NICE recommend we only add another drug if the HbA1c has risen to &gt;= 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) at this stage. However, as this patient has established cardiovascular disease he should also be given an SGLT-2 inhibitor (e.g. empagliflozin) in addition to metformin.

## Question #86

You are called to review a 43-year-old woman who has received 48 hours of treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. She has had diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort for the past 12 hours is now become increasingly confused with visual hallucinations and aggressive behaviour.

She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and Grave's disease which has been in remission and not requiring treatment.

Observations: SpO2 97% room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, heart rate 145 beats per minute, blood pressure 170/110 mmHg, temperature 40.2ºC.

On examination, she has generalised abdominal pain, mild pitting oedema, and an irregularly irregular pulse.

| FT4   | 32 pmol/L(12-22) |           |

What is the most appropriate acute treatment for the likely underlying cause of this patient's current presentation?

- a) 300mg aspirin
- b) Carbimazole
- c) IV antibiotics
- d) Propylthiouracil
- e) Thyroidectomy

Correct answer is d.

In thyroid storm, treat acutely with propylthiouracil rather than carbimazole or surgery

The stem describes a classic case of thyroid storm. It is most commonly seen in patients with a background of Grave's disease but can occur in other scenarios too. There is usually a precipitating insult such as diabetic ketoacidosis or a heart attack.

The likelihood of a thyroid storm can be calculated using the Burch and Wartofksy thyroid storm diagnostic criteria. This attributes points to the presence of pyrexia, tachycardia, signs of heart failure, confusion, coma, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbance etc.

In this case, the patient scores 90. A score of &gt;45 indicates a likely thyroid storm. The patient also has a suppressed TSH level with raised T4, this cements the diagnosis.

In an ideal situation treatment for presumed thyroid storm should not be delayed whilst awaiting blood results as this condition has significant mortality (&gt;10%). Blood tests may be in keeping with hyperthyroidism, but there is no specific cut- off to diagnose thyroid storm, the diagnosis is made on clinical findings.

Propylthiouracil is the correct answer. Patients should be assessed with an ABCDE approach and stabilised. IV fluids and cooling are important aspects of treatment. Tachyarrhythmias should also be managed according to local guidelines. The most appropriate treatment for the underlying thyroid storm is propylthiouracil. This inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and also inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3.

Carbimazole is incorrect. Although carbimazole can be used, propylthiouracil is the traditionally preferred treatment as it has a faster onset of action and also inhibits the conversion of fT4 to T3.

Thyroidectomy is incorrect. This can be used as a definitive treatment for Grave's disease and can also be used in the acute setting if a patient has had a previous poor reaction to thionamides such as propylthiouracil. Usually, the first-line treatment would be stabilisation with beta-blockers, supportive treatment and oral thionamides.

IV antibiotics is incorrect. In this case, the patient is pyrexial and has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain could indicate an intra-abdominal infection. It would not be unusual for the patient to receive IV antibiotics in this scenario to cover for potential infection, but given the blood results here - normal white cell count, normal CRP, and deranged thyroid function - we can be quite sure of a diagnosis of thyroid storm which wouldn't respond to IV antibiotics. The concomitant atrial fibrillation with signs of heart failure (pedal oedema), extreme pyrexia, and delirium, are better explained by thyroid storm.

300mg aspirin is incorrect. This would be the treatment of stroke. There is an altered conscious level with behavioural changes and pyrexia, both of which can be seen in acute stroke. There are, however, no focal neurological findings described and a stroke would not explain the change in bowel habit and abdominal pain.

## Question #87

A 78-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus is reviewed in the diabetes clinic. He is currently taking metformin 1g bd. He also has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. His HbA1c one year ago was 44 mmol/mol (6.2%). The most recent test is reported as 46 mmol/mol (6.4%). What is the most appropriate next step in management?

- a) Increase dose of metformin
- b) Add glimepiride
- c) Add sitagliptin
- d) Add pioglitazone
- e) Make no changes

Correct answer is e.

This man has acceptable glycaemic control, both in terms of NICE guidance and more recent evidence looking at the harms of overzealous glycaemic control. No changes should therefore be made for now.

## Question #88

A 35-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe right flank pain radiating to her groin. She had recently been referred to the rheumatology department by her GP for investigation of joint pains, dry eyes and dry mouth. She was not taking any regular medication.

On examination her blood pressure was 132/68 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed right flank tenderness. Blood tests are shown below:

Na +

136 mmol/L

(135 - 145)

| K +          | 2.8 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Urea         | 3.6 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine   | 70 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| Bicarbonat e | 9 mmol/L     | (22 - 28)     |
| Chloride     | 116 mmol/L   | (95 - 105)    |
| Calcium      | 2.3 mmol/L   | (2.1-2.6)     |
| Phosphate    | 1.1 mmol/L   | (0.8-1.4)     |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Bartter syndrome
- b) Fanconi syndrome
- c) Gitelman syndrome
- d) Lactic acidosis
- e) Distal renal tubular acidosis

Distal renal tubular acidosis can cause calcium phosphate renal stones and is linked to Sjogrens syndrome

This patient presents with renal colic. Blood tests show severe metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia which fits with a distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The history of dry eyes and mouth is suggestive of Sjogrens syndrome, which is frequently associated with distal RTA. Patients with distal RTA are at risk of developing calcium phosphate stones.

Fanconi syndrome causes a proximal RTA which tends to cause milder acidosis and hypokalaemia, along with other electrolyte disturbances such as hypophosphataemia.

Gitelman and Bartter syndromes cause a hypokalaemic alkalosis and are therefore incorrect.

Lactic acidosis would cause a raised anion gap acidosis, whereas the anion gap in this case is normal (12).

## Question #89

A 42-year-old man presents to endocrinology clinic. He has been seeing his GP due to developing gynaecomastia. At first, this was thought to be due to alcohol excess and possible liver involvement, but after stopping alcohol completely and normal liver function tests this diagnosis was excluded. He has no previous medical history apart from having had a tibial fracture a year ago, and having been diagnosed with migraines two months ago. He takes paracetamol for the migraines but finds this to be not very helpful, especially with the headaches at night. On more direct questioning he has also developed problems maintaining an erection. On examination he does have gynaecomastia, but apart from this he appears normal. On repeating blood tests in the clinic his liver function tests are normal, but morning serum testosterone is low, with normal FSH and LH. What further investigation is likely to be diagnostic?

- a) Liver biopsy
- b) Transferrin saturations
- c) Serum prolactin
- d) CT brain
- e) Thyroid function tests

Correct answer is c.

Hypogonadism secondary to prolactinaemia would be associated with low testosterone and low or normal FSH and LH

This patient has symptoms of hypogonadism with erectile dysfunction and gynaecomastia with a suggested evidence of a headache suspicious for an intracranial lesion, especially with a new diagnosis of headaches at night. The most likely explanation is a prolactinoma, which can be detected by very high prolactin levels. After this, an MRI of the pituitary would be appropriate. A CT brain is unlikely to be able to demonstrate any lesions. A liver biopsy could be considered if there was liver failure and it was unexplained. Transferrin saturation could be considered if haemochromatosis was considered.

## Question #90

A 66-year-old male was admitted with agitation and confusion, worsening over the past 1 week. His past medical history includes hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic back pain. His daughter noticed that he had lost about 1 stone in weight (currently weighs 71 kg), has been more tired over the last month and that he has been drinking a lot more water. This was associated with the development of urinary incontinence.

On examination, his heart rate was 108 beats/min, blood pressure was 95/42 mmHg, saturations were 94% on air and respiratory rate was 20/min. He is confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14 and appeared dehydrated.

Blood results are as follows:

Na +

125 mmol/l

K +

5.0 mmol/l

Urea

18 mmol/l

Creatinine

180 µmol/l

Blood glucose

34 mmol/l

## Venous blood gas was done and showed the following:

| pH   | 7.32        |
|------|-------------|
| pCO2 | 4.6 kPa     |
| pO2  | 6.1 kPa     |
| HCO3 | 17mmol/l    |
| BE   | -3.6 mmol/l |

Which is the most important treatment?

- a) Intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride
- b) 10 units of human actrapid stat
- c) Start insulin sliding scale at 6 units/hr
- d) Calcium gluconate
- e) Intravenous 1.8% sodium chloride

Correct answer is a.

Characteristic features of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) includes:

-  high osmolality, often 320 mosmol/kg or more
-  high blood glucose, usually 30 mmol/L or more
-  severely dehydrated and unwell.
-  without significant hyperketonaemia or acidosis

HHS typically occurs in the elderly and is often the first presentation of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Using the blood results, osmolality can be calculated with the formula 2(Na+K) +glucose+urea

Goals of treatment include:

-  Normalise the osmolality
-  Replace fluid and electrolyte losses
-  Normalise blood glucose
-  Prevention of complications: Arterial or venous thrombosis/cerebral oedema

Fluid replacement must commence first; an initial insulin bolus of 0.15 U per kg may be given once infusions are underway. Fluid replacement alone with 0.9% sodium chloride solution will result in falling blood glucose. Insulin treatment prior to adequate fluid replacement may result in cardiovascular collapse as water moves out of the intravascular space, with a resulting decline in intravascular volume.

Patients with HHS are often exquisitely sensitive to insulin and require much lower doses than in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).The recommended insulin dose is a fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) given at 0.05 units per kg per hour (e.g. 4 units/hr in an 80 kg man) is used

Beware of rapid correction of hyponatraemia, may lead to cerebral pontine myelinolysis

## Question #91

A 59-year-old man who has had type 1 diabetes mellitus for 40 years comes to the clinic for review. He has peripheral diabetic sensory neuropathy, impotence, and has received laser therapy for bilateral diabetic retinopathy. His main complaint that he is now suffering from unpredictable vomiting of undigested food. Despite modifying his diet he still suffers from the problem. On one occasion when he was admitted to hospital the condition responded well to erythromycin. Barium swallow has demonstrated significantly prolonged gastric emptying.

Which of the following is the most appropriate long-term intervention?

- a) Ondansetron
- b) Gastric pacemaker
- c) Chlorpheniramine
- d) Domperidone
- e) Erythromycin

Correct answer is d.

Diabetic gastroparesis is best managed long term with domperidone

Pro-kinetic anti-emetics are the intervention of choice for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis, the diagnosis here. Vomiting is often unpredictable and doesn't respond to dietary modification, making the condition extremely debilitating for sufferers. Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist is the main prospect for long-term intervention, as it doesn't have the neurological liabilities which are associated with metoclopramide use, it may be associated with galactorrhoea due to a rise in prolactin levels in some patients who take it.

Ondansetron, a centrally acting anti-emetic is largely ineffective for gastroparesis, erythromycin is used for acute episodes of diabetic gastroparesis, and gastric pacemaker therapy is designated a research therapy of last resort by NICE. Chlorpheniramine is an anti-histamine that has some anti-emetic properties, although it is predominantly a centrally acting agent.

## Question #92

A 62-year-old woman presents to hospital. She has been agitated over the last few days and her daughter has become concerned about this. She complains of nausea and has vomited once. She also has a cough which has been productive with a green sputum, and she has had some chest pain when she coughs. She also is confused and agitated. On examination, she has a heart rate of 150bpm, blood pressure of 103/65mmHg, temperature 40.1º and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a past medical history of myocardial infarction three years ago needing cardiac stenting, polycystic ovaries and hypertension. She has also diagnosed with hyperthyroidism four months ago but she admits poor compliance with treatment. She is supposed to take aspirin, atorvastatin, amlodipine and carbimazole. Her blood tests are pending. What feature of her presentation is most suggestive of thyroid storm?

- a) Productive cough
- b) History of aspirin use
- c) Chest pain
- d) Confusion
- e) Hyperpyrexia

Correct answer is e.

In thyroid storm, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, cardiac failure and agitation are the key diagnostic elements

This patient has features of thyroid storm. The most important features are high fever and tachycardia, with temperatures becoming very high, even above 40ºC, and heart rate can be as high as 180bpm. Thyroid storm can be triggered by infection, and therefore the productive cough is relevant but not a distinguishing feature. The use of aspirin can worsen thyrotoxicosis as well by displacing T4 from thyroid binding globulin but is not a main feature. Agitation and confusion are both features but are less discriminating than hyperpyrexia.

## Question #93

A 31-year-old female presents with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, a 5-day history of diarrhoea and vomiting and reduced appetite. She is a known type one diabetic with background diabetic retinopathy and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. She usually takes 32 units lantus at night and variable doses of Novomix with meals however due to her poor appetite she has not taken these for 2 days. On examination, she looks unwell. The airway is patent and chest is clear. Respiratory rate is 26/min with normal oxygen saturations on air. Pulse is 120/min and thready with a capillary refill of 3 seconds centrally. Blood pressure is 103/45 mmHg with a temperature of 36.7 o C. Abdomen is generally tender without guarding. Capillary blood glucose is 26 and ketones are 4.9. Arterial blood gas is as follows:

| pH           | 7.32        |
|--------------|-------------|
| pO2          | 11.6 kPa    |
| pCO2         | 3.32 kPa    |
| Bicarbonat e | 14 mmol/l   |
| Base Excess  | -6.5 mmol/l |
| Lactate      | 2.1 mmol/l  |

The patient is currently being fluid resuscitated appropriately. What form of insulin therapy would you advise?

- a) Dose of novomix now and increase usual lantus by 8 units
- b) Variable rate i.v insulin, continue all s/c insulins
- c) Recommence normal s/c insulin regimen
- d) Fixed rate i.v insulin, continue lantus
- e) Fixed rate i.v insulin, stop all s/c insulin

## Correct answer is d.

This patient has a compensated metabolic acidosis and despite her reasonably preserved pH, a bicarbonate of 14 suggests significant metabolic acidosis. In the presence of high blood ketones and hyperglycaemia, the diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Fluid therapy and potassium supplementation is a key part of DKA management but will not be dealt with in this question. Current recommendations advise fixed rate insulin with the addition of 10 % dextrose when capillary blood glucose drops below 14. The aim is to correct the underlying ketoacidosis brought about by a hypoinsulinaemic state. Patients should be continued on their long acting insulin but short/medium term insulins should be held. This ensures a smooth transfer from fixed rate to usual insulin regimen when the patient has clinically and biochemically improved.

## Question #94

A 19-year-old woman presents to the emergency department drowsy and vomiting. She is accompanied by a friend who tells you she has been out drinking all day and has been vomiting for the last few hours.

Her speech is slurred and confused, she opens her eyes in response to her name and pushes you away in response to a painful stimulus. Heart rate is 100 beats per minute and regular, blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, capillary glucose is 18 mmol/L, and a urine dip shows pH: 4, blood: trace, ketones: +++, protein: trace, nitrites: negative and leukocytes: negative.

Chest x-ray: Normal

Venous blood gas:

| pH          | 7.27 (7.35-7.45)     |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Bicarbonate | 10mmol/L (22-26)     |
| Base excess | -10 (-2 to +2)       |
| Sodium      | 135 mmol/L (137-144) |
| Potassium   | 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9) |
| Chloride    | 99 mmol/L (95-107)   |

## Serum Glucose: 21 mmol/L

What is the most important initial intervention?

- a) Fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII)
- b) Intravenous calcium gluconate
- c) Intravenous fluids
- d) Sliding scale insulin
- e) Urgent CT head

Correct answer is c.

This woman fits the diagnostic criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):

-  Ketonaemia &gt; 3.0mmol/L or significant ketonuria (more than 2+ on standard urine sticks)
-  Blood glucose &gt; 11.0mmol/L or known diabetes mellitus
-  Bicarbonate (HCO3- ) &lt; 15.0mmol/L and/or venous pH &lt; 7.3

Diabetes UK guidance states that the most important initial therapeutic intervention in DKA is appropriate fluid replacement followed by insulin administration.

The key benefits of fluid resuscitation in this context include:

-  Recovery of circulatory volume
-  Clearance of ketones and therefore improvement of acidosis
-  Correction of electrolyte imbalance

Weight based fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) is now the recommended mode of insulin administration in DKA, over sliding scale.

DKA is a complication of type i diabetes (but can rarely complicate type ii diabetes). It can be the first presentation of type i diabetes, result from poor diabe

## Question #95

A 37-year-old female presents to the medical outpatient department with a progressive loss of libido. She attributes this to persistent diarrhoea, which she has noted over the last 6 months. She has also lost 16kg of weight and feels fatigued. She has noticed that her eyes have become grossly protuberant and she has double vision on looking towards either the right or left. She also experiences painful watering of her eyes.

On examination she has a marked tremor in both hands, her heart rate is irregularly irregular and she has marked exophthalmos. There is an audible bruit on auscultation of the thyroid gland.

Her laboratory investigations reveal:

| Hb   | 130 g/l                  |
|------|--------------------------|
| MCV  | 77 fl                    |

CT scan of the orbits reveals taut optic nerves and retro-orbital oedema.

Which of the following would be the most appropriate management of her eye condition?

- a) Treatment with a block and replace regimen
- b) Treatment with radioactive iodine
- c) Treatment with IV methylprednisolone
- d) Surgical removal of the thyroid gland
- e) Orbital decompression surgery

Correct answer is c.

The question aims to address the ophthalmopathy associated with Graves disease and tests the candidates understanding of the correct approach to a patient with painful and significant eye disease. The treatment of choice is the administration of systemic steroids to lessen the inflammation and provide symptomatic relief. Treatment of the underlying thyrotoxicosis is essential, but it will not directly result in an improvement in the ophthalmopathy.

Radioactive iodine therapy may worsen Graves ophthalmopathy and should not be the initial treatment option. Treatment-induced hypothyroidism must be avoided as this may also worsen the eye problems.

## Question #96

A 45-year-old female presents with a 2-year history of headache and visual blurring. When initially presenting to her GP 2 years ago her blood pressure was found to be 235/160mmHg. Subsequently, despite maximal doses of four antihypertensives, including 50mg spironolactone, her blood pressure remains poorly controlled. Her latest blood tests demonstrate the following:

Na +

140 mmol/l

| K +         | 2.9 mmol/l   |
|-------------|--------------|
| Urea        | 5.8 mmol/l   |
| Creatinin e | 78 µmol/l    |
| CRP         | 2 mg/l       |

| Serum ambulatory renin activity   | 0.34 pmol/L @3-4 hours (normal range 0.8-3.5 pmol/ml/hr)   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serum ambulatory aldosterone      | 2052 pmol/L@ 3-4 hours (normal range 100-800)              |

A CT adrenal reveals a right adrenal mass of 2.5cm diameter. The patient is keen to take away the underlying problem. What is the most appropriate next management step?

- a) Add amiloride
- b) Add eplerenone
- c) Increase spironolactone to 100mg OD
- d) Adrenal vein sampling
- e) Right adrenalectomy

Correct answer is d.

Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be used to distinguish between unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia in primary hyperaldosteronism

The patient presents with poorly controlled hypertension, is hypokalaemic, hypertensive, metabolically alkalotic, has increased aldosterone and reduced renin. The underlying diagnosis is Conn's disease. The treatment involves removal of the aldosterone secreting tumour. However, those pursuing adrenalectomy must undergo adrenal vein sampling first, CT imaging alone is not diagnostic of the symptomatic side responsible for aldosterone secretion.

## Question #97

A 62-year-old woman attends her GP complaining of weight gain, lethargy and hair loss. She denies any intercurrent illness. Thyroid function tests are performed and the results are as follows:

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 0.3 mu/l   |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Free T4                             | 8 pmol/l   |

Which investigation is most likely to be diagnostic?

- a) Thyroid ultrasound
- b) Radio-iodine uptake scan
- c) Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies
- d) Fine-needle aspiration of thyroid
- e) MRI pituitary glan

Correct answer is e.

This patient has hypothyroidism. The vast majority of cases are primary hypothyroidism with a high TSH and low T4. The common causes are:

-  Autoimmune (Hashimoto's disease, atrophic)
-  Iodine deficiency
-  Thyroiditis (post-viral, post-partum)
-  Iatrogenic (thyroidectomy, radioiodine, drugs)

Secondary hypothyroidism is very rare and results in a low TSH and low T4. In these cases, pituitary insufficiency is most likely and therefore an MRI of the gland should be performed.

## Question #98

A 62-year-old taxi driver is reviewed in the diabetes clinic some 6 weeks after suffering from an inferior myocardial infarction, for which he was stented. Current medication for control of blood sugar is metformin 1g twice a day. Other medication of note includes ramipril and indapamide. His blood pressure is 139/85 mmHg, his pulse is 84 beats per minute and regular. There are bilateral basal crackles on auscultation of the chest consistent with cardiac failure.

HbA1c

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention with respect to his glycaemic control?

- a) Add empagliflozin
- b) Add gliclazide
- c) Add insulin glargine
- d) Add pioglitazone
- e) Add saxagliptin

Correct answer is a.

SGLT-2 inhibition is the best option for glucose control in a patient with IHD and heart failure failing glycaemic control on metformin because there is good evidence for outcome benefit across the class

This patient has a history of diabetes and cardiac failure after a myocardial infarction. Evidence in this patient group is strong for a putative benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors. In particular both empagliflozin and canagliflozin have reported outcomes data which demonstrates a reduction in mortality of around 1/3rd. Their outcome trials also demonstrate a reduction in episodes of symptomatic cardiac failure and reduced progression of microvascular complications of diabetes.

The other options are all inappropriate. Adding gliclazide is associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia, weight gain, and is not associated with positive cardiovascular outcomes. In particular, given his occupation as a taxi driver, hypoglycaemia should be avoided. Insulin glargine may promote significant weight gain, can worsen cardiac failure and does also cause hypoglycaemia. Pioglitazone promotes weight gain and fluid retention and is therefore contraindicated in cardiac failure. Saxagliptin was associated with an increase in cardiac failure in the SAVOR-TIMI cardiac outcome trial.

## Question #99

A 56-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes managed with Humalog mix 30 and metformin 1g BD comes to the clinic for review. HbA1c is currently 57. He has troublesome hypoglycaemia episodes in the late afternoon and early mornings and wants to know what to do about it. On examination his blood pressure is 132/82 mmHg, his pulse is 72 beats per minute and regular. His body mass index is 32 kg/m².

HbA1c

57 mmol/mol

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?

- a) Continue current regimen, eat a snack mid afternoon and before bed time
- b) Reduce the dose of metformin
- c) Reduce the dose of mixed insulin
- d) Switch to a basal bolus regimen
- e) Switch to Humalog mix 20

Correct answer is d.

This person's HbA1c is above target at 57 mmol/mol or 7.4%. In spite of this, he is still suffering from hypoglycaemia episodes as a result of delivering his insulin as a twice a day regimen. Moving him to basal bolus will allow splitting up of the short acting component of his insulin requirements, and therefore reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia at the end of each dosing period.

Reducing the dose of his mixed insulin may drive a further rise in his HbA1c, as would reducing the dose of metformin. Switching to Humalog mix 20 will increase the proportion of long-acting insulin and worsen the risk of hypoglycaemia. Eating a snack will drive weight gain and worsen his HbA1c.

A 32-year-old patient is due to be discharged from hospital. He has had his third admission for DKA in the last two years since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. He has come off his fixed-rate IV insulin and started to eat and drink again, and has restarted his long-acting insulin detemir (Levemir) and shortacting insulin aspart (Novorapid) as his pre-admission plan. His DKA was most likely provoked by the patient drinking alcohol and not taking his insulin. This is similar to previous admissions, but he only drinks two bottles of beer a week, but occasionally binge drinks. He has no other co-morbidities and takes no other medications. What is the most appropriate suggestion to avoid further admissions with DKA?

- a) Start metformin
- b) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin degludec (Tresiba)
- c) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30)
- d) Increase dose in insulin aspart (Novorapid) by 20%
- e) Advise reduction in carbohydrates in diet

Correct answr is b.

A patient with recurrent admissions for DKA can be started on degludec to reduce readmission rate

This is a patient with type 1 diabetes with recurrent DKA secondary to a combination of missing doses of insulin and binge drinking alcohol. The most appropriate and likely to be successful strategy is to change Levemir to Degludec. Degludec has a much higher half-life than Levemir and therefore maintains a basal insulin level when the patient omits or forgets doses. This can prevent DKA. Metformin is not indicated for this patient. Insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30) would allow reduction in the number of insulin injections. Increasing the dose of insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to prvent DKA for this patient as the fundamental issue is missing doses, and the short-term nature of the insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to provide any insulin cover for further omitted doses. Patients with type 1 diabetes can also benefit from DAFNE, a course which helps patients adjust their insulin doses to what they are eating and the patient should be offered this as an educational tool as well to improve control.

## Question #101

A 19 year-old man is referred by his GP to the outpatient department after having several episodes of collapse at college. He reports that during these episodes he feels tired and 'blacks out'. Afterwards, he feels shaky and weak. There is no tongue biting or incontinence during these episodes and the patient reports that he often feels dizzy after standing up too quickly from a chair. The only other symptoms he reports is a sore throat that has persisted for a few weeks and lethargy.

On examination of the patient's mouth and throat, there are some white plaques located at the back of the tongue and throat. His sitting blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his standing blood pressure is 95/70 mmHg. He is otherwise well.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Type II polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- b) Thymoma
- c) Type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- d) Type III polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- e) HIV

Correct answer is c.

The most likely diagnosis is type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. This autosomal recessive syndrome is a subtype of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, whereby a number of endocrine glands dysfunction. The patient's oral candidiasis is caused by a mild immune deficiency and hyposplenism. Furthermore, the patient has hypocalcaemia, caused by autoimmune dysfunction of the parathyroid gland and hypoglycaemia with hypotension, caused by autoimmune dysfunction of the adrenal gland.

## Question #102

A 78-year-old man with metastatic lung carcinoma presents with increasing lethargy and a number of falls. He describes feeling very unsteady on standing from his bed. His appetite has been poor and he has vomited two times each day for the past three days. There is no diarrhoea or abdominal pain and he denies any shortness of breath. He takes regular paracetamol for pain and omeprazole for dyspepsia.

On examination, he is a tanned gentleman with cachexia. He appears pale with dry mucosa and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is reduced air entry at the right base with bronchial breathing overlying. His heart sounds are normal and his capillary refill time is prolonged to 4 seconds. Bloods pressure is 85/65mmHg, heart rate 86/min, respiratory rate 23/min

## CT-chestabdomenpelvis

There is a 4cm mass in the right lower lobe with extension to adjacent pleura. Bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlargement of para-aortic nodes with masses seen in both adrenals. Findings are in keeping with a primary lung malignancy with metastatic spread

What is the likeliest explanation of this presentation?

- a) SIADH
- b) Terminal decline
- c) Addisonian crisis
- d) Proton pump inhibitor side effects
- e) Pneumonia

Correct anser is c.

Metastatic malignancy can cause Addison's disease

This gentleman presents in a shock like state with poor peripheral perfusion. This could be caused by pneumonia but there are no signs of sepsis and no consolidation on CT. SIADH and PPIs can cause hyponatraemia but not cardiovascular collapse. Terminal decline is the diagnosis of exclusion. This gentleman does have metastatic deposits in both adrenal glands which can impair function and cause Addison's. Furthermore, he has hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hyperpigmentation all which are features seen in Addison's.

## Question #103

A 70-year-old man with a history of smoking 15 cigarettes/day presents with drowsiness, weight loss and a persistent cough. His investigations show:

| Na +       | 115 mmol/l   | 135-145 mmol/l   |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| K +        | 5.1 mmol/l   | 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/l |

| Creatinine | 74 µmol/l    | 55-120 µmol/l    |

| Plasma osmolality   |   270 mOsm/kg | 285-295 mOsm/kg   |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Urine osmolality    |          1210 | 500 - 800 mOsm/kg |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Small cell lung cancer
- b) Hypothyroidism
- c) Encephalitis
- d) Congestive cardiac failure
- e) Squamous cell carcinoma

Correct answer is e.

A common endocrine complication of small cell lung cancer is SIADH

Hyponatraemia, reduced plasma osmolality and increased urine osmolality are suggestive of syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH).

The increase in ADH causes more aquaporin utilisation in the collecting duct system of the kidney. This causes more water to be retained, diluting the electrolytes in the blood and making the electrolytes in the urine more concentrated.

Small cell lung cancer is a common cause of SIADH and is the most likely diagnosis in this man with an extensive smoking history, cough and weight loss.

## Question #104

A 24-year-old nurse presents after collapsing on a night shift. His blood glucose is measured at being 1.4 mmol/l. His blood pressure at the time was noted to be 115/82 mmHg. He has no palpitations and had not bitten his tongue or become incontinent during the episodes. He was shaken afterwards, although did not have memory loss and stated he had not tripped over anything. He also said he has had five of these episodes over the last two weeks.

Blood tests are sent off and unremarkable except for a low-normal C-peptide level and markedly raised insulin level.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of his multiple episodes of collapse?

- a) Sulphonylurea misuse
- b) Insulin misuse
- c) Alcohol misuse
- d) Retroperitoneal sarcoma
- e) Insulinoma

Correct answedr is b.

Hyperinsulinaemia in the absence of raised C-peptide points towards the diagnosis of insulin abuse. Elevation of C-peptide, when combined with hyperinsulinaemia suggests sulphonylurea abuse. To rule this out it may be appropriate to assay levels of commonly used sulphonylureas in urine. Insulinomas are a more rare cause of repeated hypoglycaemic episodes.

## Question #105

A 28-year-old pregnant lady presents to the Emergency Department with palpitations and sweating. She mentions that she has had these symptoms on and off for the past 4 months but that they have worsened over the past few weeks. Now she is feeling worried and wanted to be assessed medically due to her concern she was having a miscarriage. She looks particularly anxious to be in hospital. This is her first pregnancy. She is 7 weeks pregnant. She has had no vaginal bleeding or discharge during the course of her pregnancy. She is normally fit and well.

Initial observations reveal a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 19/min, oxygen saturations of 99% on air and a temperature of 37.5ºC. Examination findings reveal a resting tachycardia and a subtle goitre is noted.

Blood test results are as follows:

Given the most likely diagnosis, how should this lady be managed?

- a) Watch and wait/symptomatic control with beta blockade
- b) Radioactive iodine therapy
- c) Subtotal thyroidectomy
- d) Propylthiouracil
- e) Block and replace carbimazole + thyroxine

Correct answer is d.

This lady has symptoms and biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism. This lady's symptoms predate her pregnancy, therefore it is not pregnancy induced thyrotoxicosis and will not self-limit - she will need treatment to prevent complications to her and the foetus. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated.

Subtotal thyroidectomy is a little risky and extreme during pregnancy. Carbimazole, whilst normally first line, has been associated with neonatal aplasia cutis before 12 weeks gestation and is therefore usually avoided. This leaves propylthiouracil as the current safest option. During the second trimester, propylthiouracil should be changed to carbimazole due to the potential risk of hepatotoxicity with propylthiouracil. The lowest dose that controls the hyperthyroid state should be used as both medications can cross the placenta.

## Question #106

A 52-year-old man presents to the endocrine clinic with a 1-month history of polyuria and polydipsia. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications.

## Blood results:

| Na +       | 156 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +        | 3.6 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea       | 14.2 mmol/L  | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine | 162 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |

Osmolarity studies after water deprivation are as follows:

| Urine osmolarity   | 105 mmol/L    | (300-900)   |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Plasma osmolarity  | 332.5 mOsm/kg | (275 - 295) |

Results following administration of desmopressin:

| Urine osmolarity   | 322 mmol/L    | (300-900)   |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Plasma osmolarity  | 324.5 mOsm/kg | (275 - 295) |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Complete cranial diabetes insipidus
- b) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
- c) Partial cranial diabetes insipidus
- d) Primary polydipsia
- e) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release

## Water deprivation test: cranial DI

-  urine osmolality after fluid deprivation: low
-  urine osmolality after desmopressin: high

Complete cranial diabetes insipidus is correct. The water deprivation test confirms a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) due to a failure of the urine to concentrate with dehydration (urine osmolarity &lt;300 mmol/L). Following administration of desmopressin there is a &gt;50% rise in urine osmolarity confirming the diagnosis of cranial DI.

Partial cranial diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This subtype of cranial DI is confirmed when the patient's symptoms resolve with desmopressin however the urine osmolarity fails to meet the diagnostic criteria (e.g. &gt;50% increase).

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This condition is characterised by the failure of the urine to concentrate with desmopressin.

Primary polydipsia is incorrect. This condition is characterised by a normal physiological response to water deprivation e.g. the urine will concentrate (&gt;600

mmol/L).

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release is incorrect. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) is associated with hyponatraemia, a decreased plasma osmolarity (&lt;275 mOsm/kg), a relatively low urine osmolarity (&lt; 100 mOsm/kg), and a high urinary sodium (&gt; 40 mmol/L).

## Question #107

A 28-year-old woman is due to be discharged from the hospital. She was admitted four days ago following a month of feeling unwell with vomiting, postural dizziness and weight loss. Following a Synacthen test, she was diagnosed with Addison's disease. She was started on treatment with hydrocortisone three times a day, as well as fludrocortisone on a daily basis. She has had no other medical problems or treatments in the past. She has been taking hydrocortisone 10mg at 09:00 and then 5mg at 12:00 and 15:00. On discharge she informs the medical team that she sometimes does shift-work. What is the most appropriate advise to give regarding steroid dosing for night shifts?

- a) Take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00 regardless of shift patterns
- b) Adjust to take first dose at waking, then doses at three hours and six hours from starting
- c) On shift days take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00, but also take an additional 10mg at starting shift
- d) On shift days take doses at 09:00, but then take second dose at starting shift and third dose six hours into shift
- e) On shift days omit taking steroids

Correct answer is b.

For patients on steroid replacement when working shift work, doses should be taken from when waking

Patients with Addison's disease need both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Cortisol is highly linked to diurnal rhythm - which is why cortisol naturally peaks in the morning and is at its nadir between midnight and 04:00. Replacement should aim to match the natural rhythm as much as possible; dosing is normally split between three doses, first on waking, then at midday and early afternoon. When a patient shifts their daytime routine, such as working on night shifts or travelling, the patient should be advised to take their morning dose on waking and maintain the timing from there. Patients should not be advised to omit doses, and encouraged to always ensure they are well supplied.

## Question #108

A 33-year-old woman presents to the endocrinology clinic for review. She has a past medical history of Graves' disease which was treated with radioiodine treatment. This finished one year ago. Following this, she has retained a clinically and biochemically euthyroid state. She originally presented with weight loss and insomnia, and these symptoms have not re-occurred. Her GP has requested blood tests prior to the appointment which has shown a TSH of 2.6 and a free T4 of 8.2mg/dl. She wanted to have a review as she has recently stopped taking oral contraceptive tablets and is planning to become pregnant. What is the most appropriate plan?

- a) Advise to avoid pregnancy
- b) Measure serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies
- c) Arrange for US scan of neck
- d) Repeat TSH and free T4 in one year's time
- e) Measure thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies

Correct answer is b.

Pregnant woman with a history of Grave's disease should have thyroid stimulating hormone binding antibody titres measured even if euthyroid as the antibodies can cross the placental barrier

This is a patient with a past medical history of Graves' disease who is clinically and biochemically euthyroid who is planning pregnancy. It is important, even with no biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism, to exclude the serum presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies as these can cross the placenta and cause foetal problems. If they were positive, then treatment should be initiated to control the antibody levels, despite the normal TSH and T4. Thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies should be checked in hyperthyroidism at 30-36 weeks gestation to help assess the risk of neonatal thyroid problems. There is no reason she should not become pregnant.

## Question #109

A 30-year-old male with background of type one diabetes mellitus presents with abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Investigations confirm he has diabetic ketoacidosis. Which one of the following investigations would suggest a discussion for possible intensive care admission?

- a) Lactate 3 mmol/L
- b) Bicarbonate level 19 mmol/L
- c) pH 7.27
- d) White cell count 30 x 10^9/L
- e) Potassium 3.4 mmol/L

Correct answer is e.

Parameters indicate severe diabetic ketoacidosis:

-  pH &lt; 7
-  Blood ketone &gt; 6 mmol/L
-  Bicarbonate &lt; 5 mmol/L
-  Anion gap &gt;16 mmol/l
-  Potassium &lt; 3.5 mmol/L on admission
-  Tachycardia or bradycardia
-  Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg
-  Oxygen saturation &lt;92% on air
-  GCS &lt; 12

## Question #110

A 49-year-old man presents with feeling under the weather. On further questioning he reports that he has been feeling tired and weak for the past few weeks and his wife has noticed that he as lost some weight, although he states that his appetite has not decreased and if anything he is feeling more thirsty and going to the toilet several times a night. Over the last couple of days he has noticed a rash develop around his groin, which is now present on his buttocks. On examination, there are patches of red with irregular borders and crusting.

A fasting blood test is arranged and reveals a blood glucose of 9.2 mm/l.

What is the next most appropriate investigation?

- a) Plasma insulin level
- b) Tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTA) test
- c) Plasma glucagon level
- d) Skin biopsy
- e) Plasma zinc level

Correct answer is c.

This patient has a diagnosis of a glucagonoma. The polydipsia and polyuria, coupled with the fasting blood glucose result suggest diabetes and the rash is necrolytic migratory erythema a symptom which is the presenting problem in up to 70% of cases of glucagonoma.

## Question #111

A 22-year-old woman attends the clinic with a 12-month history of infertility and irregular periods. She also complains of excess hair growth over her face and chest. Observations are as follows: heart rate 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, SpO2 98% (on air),

| Early morning cortisol | 140 nmol/l    | (>350)                                |

## What investigation is required?

- a) ACTH stimulation testing
- b) Dexamethasone suppression test
- c) Karyotyping
- d) Serum prolactin
- e) Transvaginal ultrasound

Correct answer Is a.

ACTH stimulation testing may be used to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia

ACTH stimulation testing is correct. The clinical and biochemical features suggest non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This form is milder, more common, and often diagnosed in later childhood or early adulthood. Usually, women with non-classic CAH present with signs of excess androgens (i.e., excess body hair, early puberty, irregular periods). Hypoaldosteronism (e.g. hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis) can also occur. The biochemical features and low early morning cortisol in this case are highly suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.

Dexamethasone suppression test is incorrect. Although Cushing's disease remains within the differential diagnosis, there are no other clinical (e.g. hypertension, proximal myopathy, weight gain, easy bruising) or biochemical features (e.g. hyperglycaemia, hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia) to support this diagnosis. Furthermore, the low early morning cortisol makes this an unlikely diagnosis.

Karyotyping is incorrect. Although Turner's syndrome can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.

Serum prolactin is incorrect. Although hyperprolactinaemia can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.

Transvaginal ultrasound is incorrect. Although ovarian tumours can result in androgen excess, this usually results in virilization which is not present in this case. Furthermore, hypoaldosteronism would not be expected to occur with ovarian pathology.

A 42-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of neck pain and swelling that worsens upon swallowing. She also reports fatigue, tremors, nervousness, occasional palpitations, and unintentional weight loss. Examination reveals blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and temperature of 37.8 ºC. The thyroid gland is tender on palpation and enlarged without any palpable nodules. Laboratory results are as follows:

| TSH     | 0.1 mIU/L ng/mL   | (0.4 - 4.0)   |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Free T4 | 8 ng/dL           | (0.7 - 1.9)   |
| ESR     | 101 mm/hr         |               |

Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies are mildly elevated, while radioactive iodine uptake is low.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Acute infectious thyroiditis
- b) Graves disease
- c) Hashimoto thyroiditis
- d) Solitary toxic nodule
- e) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis

Correct answer is e.

Thyrotoxicosis with tender goitre = subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis , also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, is the correct diagnosis. The patient presents with clinical and biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by tachycardia, tremors, nervousness, low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, palpitations, suppressed TSH, and elevated free T4 levels. These symptoms, in conjunction with an enlarged tender thyroid gland and high ESR level, are indicative of de Quervain's thyroiditis. Typically following a viral infection (not specified in this scenario), this condition is characterised by an initial phase of thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. Management often involves symptomatic relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and betablockers.

Acute infectious thyroiditis , or suppurative thyroiditis, is a rare and potentially serious condition usually seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Gram-positive bacterial infections mainly cause it. Symptoms include sudden-onset fever, chills, malaise, a tender, painful thyroid gland, and signs of hyperthyroidism. In severe cases, the infection causes compression on adjacent structures, leading to dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. It is important to note that de Quervain's thyroiditis has a gradual onset of symptoms and does not cause compression symptoms, making acute infectious thyroiditis less likely.

Graves' disease is not the appropriate diagnosis here. Despite the biochemical and clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, specific anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and a low radioactive iodine uptake are inconsistent with this condition.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a relevant differential diagnosis; however, it typically presents with a painless goitre. In de Quervain's thyroiditis, mild elevations in antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies may be observed in fewer than 25% of cases. By contrast, these antibody levels are significantly higher in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Solitary toxic nodule is not consistent with this case presentation. Such nodules are generally single, palpable and non-tender associated with thyrotoxicosis. In contrast to this condition, the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and tender with no palpable; the findings align with de Quervain's thyroiditis rather than a solitary toxic nodule.

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis , also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, is the correct diagnosis. The patient presents with clinical and biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by tachycardia, tremors, nervousness, low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, palpitations, suppressed TSH, and elevated free T4 levels.

## Question #117

A 32 year-old man is referred by his GP after collapsing while at work. He does not remember the episode but witnesses say that there was no incontinence or fitting and the patient does not have a sore mouth or tongue. This is the first time this has happened and the patient does not have any other past medical history of note and takes no regular medication.

Examination reveals a blood pressure of 162/95 mmHg, a pulse of 74 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 and a temperature of 37.4ºC. Heart sounds 1 and 2 are present with no added sounds, the lung fields are clear and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

## Blood tests performed and reveal:

| Na +         | 143 mmol/l   |
|--------------|--------------|
| K +          | 3.0 mmol/l   |
| Urea         | 5.6 mmol/l   |
| Creatinine   | 76 µmol/l    |
| Bicarbonate  | 31 mmol/l    |
| Renin        | low          |
| Aldosteron e | low          |

Which of the following is the best treatment?

- a) Amiloride
- b) Bumetanide
- c) Spironolactone
- d) ACE inhibitor
- e) Angiotensin II receptor blocker

Correct answer is a.

This man has Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by hypertension associated with hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, low plasma renin activity, and suppressed aldosterone secretion. Amiloride is the best treatment for the hypertension and hypokalaemia as it acts on the sodium channels directly, as opposed to spironolactone, which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors.

## Question #118

A 24-year-old female presents with one week of progressive and persistent double vision. She reports increasing tiredness at all times of day over the past 2 months and occasional chest tightness associated with palpitations. She has no past medical history. She was also adopted and unaware of any family history. On examination, you find a loss of left eye abduction, right eye upwards gaze, right eye adduction. Systemic examination also reveals bilateral clammy hands and a heart rate of 120 per minute, irregular. Which test is most likely to be diagnostic?

- a) Autoimmune screen
- b) Thyroid function tests
- c) CT thorax
- d) Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodie
- e) 12 lead ECG

Correct answer is b.

This patient presents with systemic symptoms and a complex ophthalmoplegia, the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease, secondary to Graves disease, is most likely. The important test would be thyroid function tests and also MRI of her orbits, which would almost certainly demonstrate retro-orbital and extraocular muscle inflammation. The severity of the patient's eye disease needs to be assessed: the most frequently used criteria was developed by the American thyroid association, which spells out helpfully NO SPECS

Class 0 No symptoms or signs

Class I Only signs, no symptoms (lid retraction, stare, lid lag)

Class II Soft tissue involvement

Class III Proptosis

Class IV Extraocular muscle involvement

Class V Corneal involvement

Class VI Sight loss (optic nerve involvement)

Any patient presenting with eye movement weaknesses that cannot be explained by isolated or multiple cranial nerve palsies is called complex ophthalmoplegia. The differentials include myasthenia gravis, mononeuritis multiplex, thyroid eye disease, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, complex progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Miller-Fisher syndrome and botulinum poisoning.

## Question #119

A 55 year-old female presents to the outpatients department having been referred by her GP. She complains of fatigue, increased sweating and weight loss over the past four months. She also reports a loss of sex drive.

Examination reveals that she is pale and has a pulse rate of 121 per minute with a bounding pulse character. Her blood pressure is 118/79 mmHg and she has heart sounds 1 and 2 presents with no added sounds. On auscultation, her chest is clear and her abdomen is soft and non-tender with no organomegaly. She has a smooth goitre but has no signs of thyroid eye disease. Examination of her cranial nerves are normal.

The results of recent blood tests are as follows:

| Hb        | 11.3 g/dl      |
|-----------|----------------|
| Platelets | 190 * 10 9 /l  |
| WBC       | 10.9 * 10 9 /l |
| Na +      | 129 mmol/l     |
| K +       | 4.3 mmol/l     |
| Urea      | 7.9 mmol/l     |

| Creatinin e   | 94 µmol/l   |
|---------------|-------------|
| ALP           | 155 u/l     |
| Calcium       | 2.40 mmol/l |
| Albumin       | 40 g/L      |
| TSH           | 11 mU/L     |
| Free T4       | 41 pmol/L   |
| Free T3       | 11 pmol/L   |

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Grave's disease
- b) Thyroid cancer
- c) Surreptitious thyroxine ingestion
- d) De Quervain's thyroiditis
- e) TSH secreting pituitary tumour

## Correct answer is e.

Biochemistry reveals elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with concurrent elevated thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3). An elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is consistent with thyrotoxicosis. Hyponatraemia suggests hypoadrenalism.

Taken with the symptoms, this patient has a likely diagnosis of a thyrotropinoma, which is a rare type of pituitary tumour accounting for approximately less than 1% of cases of pituitary tumours. 90% are macroadenomas.

Presentation is typically with features of thyrotoxicosis and include weight loss, sweating, fatigue and tachycardia. There may also be signs of hypopituitarism.

## Question #120

A 54-year-old man presents to the diabetes clinic for review. He has had symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia and lethargy over the past few months, and his fasting glucose is elevated at 7.6 mmol/l. He has no history of diabetes in his family and is currently treated for hypertension and dyslipidaemia by his GP. On examination his blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 70 beats per minute and regular. His body mass index is 34 kg/m². Other blood tests of note include GAD+ antibodies, renal function is normal.

Which of the following is most appropriate with respect to managing his glucose control?

- a) Gliclazide
- b) Liraglutide
- c) Metformin
- d) Sitagliptin
- e) Basal bolus insulin

Correct  answer is c.

Up to 10% of patients who are thought to have type 2 diabetes are found to also be GAD autoantibody positive. These individuals are thought to progress faster to insulin start than patients with autoantibody negative type 2 diabetes, (within 3-5 years vs 7 years on average for 'standard' patients).

The management of these patients is the same as for patients with autoantibody negative disease, metformin as the initial therapy of choice. Weight reduction may delay progression to insulin, therefore insulin sparing strategies, at least during the first few years after diagnosis are the preferred intervention. These may include use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists.

Question #121

A 40-year-old woman found a neck lump that was palpable in the left lobe of her thyroid gland. She was clinically euthyroid.

TSH

3.6 (NR 0.4-5.0)

free T4

15.1 (NR 10-25)

corrected calcium

2.41 (NR 2.2-2.6)

USS: 1.7 x 1.6cm solid lesion in left lobe of thyroid with microcalcification.

What is the next step in management?

- a) Fine needles aspiration cytology
- b) Radio-iodine uptake scan
- c) Left lobectomy
- d) Calcitonin level
- e) Thyroglobulin level

Correct answer is a.

This nodule Is suspicious for malignancy because: microcalcifications, solid lesion, and no evidence of a hot lesion (as euthyroid). The next step is therefore FNA of the nodule.

Work up for thyroid nodules is as follows:

1. Check TSH
2. TSH suppressed → Thyroid uptake scan → Cold/iso nodule → FNA cytology
2. TSH suppressed → Thyroid uptake scan →Hot nodule → No FNA required
2. TSH normal/elevated → Thyroid USS → Suspicious features → FNA cytology
3. FNA cytology is then graded using the Royal College of Pathologist classification on a spectrum from benign → malignant.

## Question #122

A 67-old-lady presents a week after a recent episode of Campylobacter gastroenteritis with increased thirst and passing urine. She estimates that she drinks 9-10 glasses of water or tea a day which is twice what she would normally have. In addition, her urine is clear in colour. She feels low in energy with easy fatigue but is able to continue her voluntary work at a local shop. She reports occasional cramps in her legs after standing for some time. She takes indapamide for hypertension but is otherwise well.

On examination, she appears euvolaemic with moist mucosa and no oedema. Her abdomen is soft with bowel sounds . She appears slow, overweight and lethargic. with a There are no neck masses or eye changes. Blood pressure is 105/90mmHg and heart rate is 67/min.

Water deprivation test

pending

What is the likeliest cause of these symptoms?

- a) Addison's disease
- b) Hypothyroidism
- c) Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion
- d) Psychogenic polydipsia
- e) Hypokalaemia

Correct answer is e.

Hypokalaemia is a rare cause of polyuria and polydipsia

This lady has polydipsia and polyuria. Of the above options, only hypokalaemia and psychogenic polydipsia are recognised causes of these symptoms. Hyperthyroidism can rarely cause polydipsia but not hypothyroidism. Addison's disease can cause hypercalcaemia which can cause these symptoms but her calcium is normal. Psychogenic polydipsia can occur but this is usually a chronic problem. This lady has presented very soon after her gastroenteritis and has evidence of hypokalaemia making this a rare but the likeliest cause of her symptoms. Her indapamide is probably contributing to the persistent hypokalaemia and should be stopp

## Question #123

A 38-year-old woman is 10 weeks pregnant and presents with increasing fatigue, weight gain and feeling very cold. Moreover, her main issue is constipation only responsive to large doses of laxatives. In recent years she has had well-controlled hypothyroidism on 50 micrograms of levothyroxine.

On examination her hair is very thin, her skin feels slightly waxy, she has mild peripheral oedema and has a larger body habitus than previously.

## Blood tests are as follows:

| Calcium                           | 2.4 mmol/L   | (2.1-2.6)   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Phosphate                         | 1.1 mmol/L   | (0.8-1.4)   |
| Magnesium                         | 0.8 mmol/L   | (0.7-1.0)   |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 5.0 mU/L     | (0.5-5.5)   |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 9.8 pmol/L   | (9.0 - 18)  |

What is the best next management option?

- a) 100 micrograms levothyroxine
- b) 25 micrograms levothyroxine
- c) 75 micrograms levothyroxine
- d) Continue 50 micrograms levothyroxine
- e) Stop the levothyroxine

Women with hypothyroidism may need to increase their thyroid hormone replacement dose by up to 50% as early as 4-6 weeks of pregnancy

75 micrograms levothyroxine is the correct answer. This is because during pregnancy (as early as 4-6 weeks) the amount of thyroglobulin binding protein increases, thus there is less free thyroid hormone in the bloodstream exacerbating this woman's state of hypothyroidism. Increasing the dose of 50 by 50% to 75 is usually sufficient as a measure to induce a state of euthyroid.

25 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would worsen the state of hypothyroidism.

Continue 50 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would not address the issue of the state of hypothyroidism on the current dose.

Stop the levothyroxine is incorrect as this would almost certainly exacerbate the state of hypothyroidism yet further.

100 micrograms levothyroxine is incorrect as this would be an increase on the dose by 100%; at this stage most likely too much and may cause a state of hyperthyroidism.

## Question #124

A 62-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the clinic for review. She has a history of mild cardiac failure managed with ramipril and bisoprolol. Her current medication for diabetes is metformin 1g BD. On examination her blood pressure is 122/82 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. There are bilateral basal crackles on auscultation of the chest, and pitting oedema of both ankles. Her body mass index is elevated at 33 kg/m².

HbA1c

73 mmol/mol

Creatinine

82 µmol/l

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for managing glucose control?

- a) Empagliflozin
- b) Glipizide
- c) Liraglutide
- d) Pioglitazone
- e) Saxagliptin

Correct answer is a.

This patient has moderate obesity with a BMI of 33, cardiac failure, and a poorly controlled HbA1c at 33. Out of the available options empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor is the most appropriate. As well as lowering blood glucose, SGLT-2 inhibition also has a diuretic like effect, lowering blood pressure and reducing fluid retention. Empagliflozin has also been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality, and this patient is at high risk of an event.

Glipizide is inappropriate as it may drive further weight gain in a patient who is already obese, saxagliptin is recognised to cause heart failure, and pioglitazone has also been shown in clinical trials to cause fluid retention. This leaves liraglutide as the other potential option, which doesn't significantly impact on fluid balance and according to NICE is only indicated at BMI of 35 and above.

## Question #125

A 44-year-old woman is admitted to hospital complaining of a swollen breast for three days. She is otherwise well, having no medical problems. She is diagnosed by the surgical team with a breast abscess, which is drained and she is started on antibiotic treatment. Before being discharged, she is found to have elevated corrected calcium (2.79 mmol/L) and elevated parathyroid hormone (9.5 pmol/L).

She is reviewed by the endocrine team. She does not have any symptoms apart from those related to her breast abscess, and additional examination is unremarkable. Further tests are requested, showing that vitamin D levels are normal, 24-hour urine calcium is normal, and a DEXA scan is normal as well. She is advised to see her GP for annual blood tests for calcium levels and renal function.

She is diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism. What additional investigation should be used to monitor her?

- a) 24-hour urine calcium annually
- b) Breast ultrasound annually
- c) Abdominal X-ray annually
- d) Abdominal ultrasound every three years
- e) DEXA scan every one to two years

## Correct answer is e.

The correct answer is a DEXA scan. This patient has been incidentally found to have primary hyperparathyroidism and has no evidence of indications for parathyroidectomy. Monitoring should include renal function and DEXA scanning to identify any decline in renal function, worsening hypercalcaemia or osteoporosis. Any of these changes would be indications for surgery. Abdominal Xrays and ultrasound scanning may be useful in the acute setting to detect renal stones but are not recommended as monitoring. Urinary calcium useful at diagnosis to exclude hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia.

## Question #126

A 25-year-old woman is referred urgently to the endocrinology clinic. She became pregnant three weeks ago. She had been suffering from diarrhea for the last month, and despite taking the oral contraceptive pill, became pregnant. She went to see her GP who requested blood tests as well as organizing an antenatal referral. Her full blood count, renal profile and liver function tests are all normal, but her TSH is undetectable and her free T4 levels are 52pmol/l. By the time of referral she has also had thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies which are positive. She has no past medical history. What is the most appropriate management for her hyperthyroidism?

- a) Hemithyroidectomy
- b) Carbimazole
- c) Propylthiouracil
- d) Propranolol
- e) Total thyroidectomy

Correct answer is c.

In pregnant woman who develop hyperthyroidism in the first trimester, propylthiouracil is preferred over carbimazole due to lower risk of foetal malformation

This patient has a new diagnosis of Graves' disease with positive thyroidstimulating hormone receptor antibodies whilst pregnant in the first trimester. The most appropriate medical treatment is propylthiouracil. This has a lower risk of foetal malformation than carbimazole in the first trimester and would, therefore, be first-line treatment. Radioiodine is contra-indicated in pregnancy, whilst propranolol would not address the underlying problem. Surgery can be an option to patients who are resistant to propylthiouracil, and would need to happy at an urgent basis. Of operations, a hemithyroidectomy is more appropriate in trying to obtain histological samples in suspicious histology, whilst a total thyroidectomy would be a definitive management. Urgent treatment is necessary as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies cross the placenta and can cause foetal problems.

## Question #127

A 32-year-old pregnant woman (26 weeks) presents to her GP because she has been feeling increasingly tired. She is normally fit and well and has had one previous pregnancy which was uneventful. A fasting blood glucose is 5.4 mmol/L. Urine dip is negative and her blood pressure is 134/78 mmHg. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 116 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets | 270 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC       | 7.3 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |

| Na +         | 136 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +          | 3.9 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Bicarbonat e | 25 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |
| Urea         | 6.5 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine   | 89 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |

| Bilirubin   | 4 µmol/L   | (3 - 17)   |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| ALP         | 170 u/L    | (30 - 100) |
| ALT         | 20 u/L     | (3 - 40)   |
| Î³GT        | 55 u/L     | (8 - 60)   |
| Albumi n    | 37 g/L     | (35 - 50)  |

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Acute cholecystitis
- b) Gestational diabetes
- c) Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
- d) Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseas
- e) Normal pregnancy

Normal pregnancy can cause a raised ALP - it doesn't necessarily imply liver problems

The only abnormal finding is a slightly raised ALP. ALP is found in bone, liver, kidney, and intestinal and placental tissue, so ALP tends to rise during pregnancy. In pregnant women levels of up to twice that upper limit can still be normal.

Acute cholecystitis would usually present with abdominal symptoms and right upper quadrant tenderness. It is important to bear in mind that the risk of gallstones increases during pregnancy, as oestrogen can lead to higher cholesterol levels in bile.

Diagnosis (according to NICE) can be made based on either a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L or above, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or above. Her fasting plasma glucose is below the threshold.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with itching (particularly in palms and soles) and can lead to complications for both mother and baby if untreated. LFTs are usually deranged but may be normal on some occasions.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is excessive fat build-up in the liver without another clear cause. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated liver enzymes are common in both but would not typically present with just an isolated rise in ALP. There is also no reason for this young fit woman to have NAFLD.

## Question #128

A 27-year-old female was seen in the general medicine outpatient clinic following a referral by her GP. She had presented to her GP feeling generally tired for the last few months. Her GP organised a blood screen revealing no abnormalities except the presence of a potassium level of 2.8 mmol/l. Her GP subsequently repeated the test four weeks later revealing a level of 2.6 mmol/l, leading to the referral to the clinic. Other than the tiredness she was well in herself, denying all other symptoms. She denied specifically the presence of any cardiovascular and muscular symptoms and had never collapsed. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she was taking no prescribed medication. There was no family history of note.

Examination revealed a well 27-year-old lady. Her blood pressure was 108/78 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm and BMI 23kg/m². Examination of her cardiovascular and respiratory systems revealed the presence of normal heart sounds, a JVP of 3cm and warm well perfused peripheries. Examination of her gastrointestinal and neurological systems was unremarkable.

Investigations conducted at the clinic revealed the following results:

| Hb         | 122 g/l       |
|------------|---------------|
| Platelet s | 242 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC        | 7.8 * 10 9 /l |

| Na +        | 132 mmol/l   |
|-------------|--------------|
| K +         | 2.5 mmol/l   |
| Urea        | 7.2 mmol/l   |
| Creatinine  | 68 µmol/l    |
| Bicarbonate | 37 mmol/l    |

Serum renin

824 (NR 100-500 pmol/l)

| Serum aldosterone   | 82 (NR 55-250 pmol/l)   |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| TSH                 | 1.2 mu/l                |

## 24 hour urine result:

| Na+      | 28 (NR <20mmol/L if hyponatraemia)   |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| K+       | 45 (NR <10mmol/l if hypokalaemic)    |
| Calciu m | 0.8 (NR <7.5 mmol/24hrs)             |

## What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Addison's disease
- b) Gitelman's syndrome
- c) Conn's disease
- d) Bartter's syndrome
- e) Laxative abuse

Correct answer is b.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

Gitelman's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a normotensive hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hypocalciuria and is often accompanied with hypomagnesaemia. The defect is in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride symporter within the distal convoluted tubules, in contrast to Bartter's syndrome which presents in the same way but with hypercalciuria owing to a defect within the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with both conditions are often asymptomatic or may complain of fatigue, cramps and weakness. Conn's disease is associated with hypertension and in this instance the aldosterone level is normal with an elevated renin, making this diagnosis unlikely. Both Addison's disease and laxative abuse are associated with a metabolic acidosis; in Addison's serum potassium also tends to be elevated. The best answer is, therefore, Gitelman's syndrome.

## Question #129

A 34-year-old woman calls the endocrinology nurse for advice. She has been vomiting for the last 24 hours and has been unable to take her regular medications. She has a past medical history of Addison's disease. She normally takes oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Apart from vomiting and reduced oral intake she denies any symptoms. Specifically, she has not been dizzy on standing, had any blackouts or any diarrhoea. She has also been having a normal temperature. She has IM hydrocortisone at home.

What is the most appropriate advice to give in regards to her hydrocortisone?

- a) Advise her to come to the emergency department for IV hydrocortisone
- b) Advise her to take the IM hydrocortisone at home whilst vomiting
- c) Advise her to not take any hydrocortisone until the vomiting settles
- d) Adviser her to take IM hydrocortisone only if starting to feel faint or experiencing postural symptoms
- e) Advise her to try and take both IM and oral hydrocortisone

Correct answer is b.

A person with Addisons' who vomits should take IM hydrocortisone until vomiting stops

This is a patient with Addison's disease who is unable to take her regular oral hydrocortisone and is therefore at risk of developing an Addisonian crisis. If unable to take the normal oral hydrocortisone then the patient should be advised to take IM hydrocortisone to avoid this. This is why all patients with Addison's disease should have IM hydrocortisone for these situations. If the patient was unwell with systemic involvement then admission for IV fluids and IV hydrocortisone would be appropriate.

## Question #130

A 42-year-old woman presents with feeling warm and more anxious than usual. She had an upper respiratory tract infection three weeks ago. On examination, you find a new tender goitre.

You send blood tests including thyroid function tests which are outlined in the table below.

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 0.2 mU/L   | (0.5-5.5)   |
|-------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 25 pmol/L  | (9.0 - 18)  |

Given the likely underlying diagnosis, what results do you expect from thyroid scintigraphy?

- a) Globally normal uptake
- b) Globally increased uptake
- c) Globally reduced uptake
- d) Well defined area of decreased uptake
- e) Well defined area of increased uptake

Correct answer is c.

De Quervain's thyroiditis: initial hyperthyroidism, painful goitre and globally reduced uptake of iodine-131

Subacute thyroiditis is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism and a new painful goitre. The investigation of choice is thyroid scintigraphy which reveals globally reduced uptake of iodine-131. Most cases are self-limiting and do not require treatment. The other answers provided are not the most common expected findings for De Quervain's thyroiditis.

Global normal uptake with uniform uptake of iodine-131 is most associated with a normal thyroid gland. Given the abnormal thyroid function and painful goitre, this would be an unexpected result in this case.

Globally increased uptake is most commonly associated with Grave's disease.

A well-defined area of decreased uptake would be most consistent with a cold (hypofunctioning) thyroid nodule. This finding would also not be consistent with the painful goitre or hyperthyroidism noted on blood tests in this case.

## Question #131

A 52 year old lady presents complaining of polydipsia and polyuria. She has a background of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and bipolar affective disorder and a strong family history of diabetes - she is unsure which type.

Results show the following:

| Na+               | 131mmol/l                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| urine osmolality  | 287mOsmol/kg (300 - 900mOsmol/kg) |
| plasma osmolality | 287mOsmol/kg (285 - 295mOsmol/kg) |

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this lady's symptoms?

- a) Psychogenic polydipsia
- b) Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH)
- c) Diabetes insipidus
- d) Diabetes mellitus type
- e) Hyponatraemia

Correct answer is a.

Although this lady is biochemically hyponatraemic, this is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms.

With a past medical history of bipolar affective disorder, although not stated in the question, there is a good chance she may be on lithium which predisposes her to developing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However with this diagnosis, we would expect a much lower urine osmolality and a higher plasma osmolality. She would also have a normal to high serum sodium. The opposite would indicate a diagnosis of SIADH (serum hypo-osmolality and high urine osmolality).

The osmolality results here reflect a diagnosis of psychogenic polydipsia with a low urine osmolality and a low end of normal plasma osmolality.

## Question #132

A 40-year-old school teacher presented to the medical assessment unit with a 2month history of polyuria and elevated blood glucose levels. There was no family history of diabetes and she was not currently on any medication. On examination, her body mass index was 22 kg/m 2 with normal general physical and systemic examination. Urine was negative for ketones.

| Blood glucose   | 16.5 mmol/l   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| pH              | 7.40          |
| HCO 3           | 25 mmol/l     |
| Na +            | 140 mmol/l    |
| K +             | 3.7 mmol/l    |

Which one of the following test may be useful in establishing the underlying diagnosis considering her clinical profile?

- a) Oral glucose tolerance test
- b) Serum ferritin and total iron binding capacity
- c) Mitochondrial gene mutation (A3243G)
- d) Anti-GAD antibody
- e) Toxicology screen

Correct answer is d.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood is a subtype of diabetes in which patients may present with phenotypic features of T2DM, while displaying the presence of markers of autoimmunity (anti-GAD antibodies)

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood is a subtype of diabetes in which patients may present with phenotypic features of type 2 DM, while displaying the presence of markers of autoimmunity (anti-GAD antibodies). Most of these patients are in the age group of 30-50 years, may or may not have a normal BMI and may present with elevated blood glucose levels. These patients can be managed initially with oral hypoglycaemic agents, although the β-cell function may decline over months to a few years, necessitating a relatively early requirement for insulin use.

## Question #133

A 40-year-old school teacher presented to the medical assessment unit with a 2month history of polyuria and elevated blood glucose levels. There was no family history of diabetes and she was not currently on any medication. On examination, her body mass index was 22 kg/m 2 with normal general physical and systemic examination. Urine was negative for ketones.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood is a subtype of diabetes in which patients may present with phenotypic features of type 2 DM, while displaying the presence of markers of autoimmunity (anti-GAD antibodies). Most of these patients are in the age group of 30-50 years, may or may not have a normal BMI and may present with elevated blood glucose levels. These patients can be managed initially with oral hypoglycaemic agents, although the β-cell function may decline over months to a few years, necessitating a relatively early requirement for insulin use.

A 25-year-old woman is referred urgently to the endocrinology clinic. She became pregnant three weeks ago. She had been suffering from diarrhea for the last month, and despite taking the oral contraceptive pill, became pregnant. She went to see her GP who requested blood tests as well as organizing an antenatal referral. Her full blood count, renal profile and liver function tests are all normal, but her TSH is undetectable and her free T4 levels are 52pmol/l. By the time of referral she has also had thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies which are positive. She has no past medical history. What is the most appropriate management for her hyperthyroidism?

- a) Hemithyroidectomy
- b) Carbimazole
- c) Propylthiouracil
- d) Propranolol
- e) Total thyroidectomy

## Correct answer is c.

In pregnant woman who develop hyperthyroidism in the first trimester, propylthiouracil is preferred over carbimazole due to lower risk of foetal malformation

This patient has a new diagnosis of Graves' disease with positive thyroidstimulating hormone receptor antibodies whilst pregnant in the first trimester. The most appropriate medical treatment is propylthiouracil. This has a lower risk of foetal malformation than carbimazole in the first trimester and would, therefore, be first-line treatment. Radioiodine is contra-indicated in pregnancy, whilst propranolol would not address the underlying problem. Surgery can be an option to patients who are resistant to propylthiouracil, and would need to happy at an urgent basis. Of operations, a hemithyroidectomy is more appropriate in trying to obtain histological samples in suspicious histology, whilst a total thyroidectomy would be a definitive management. Urgent treatment is necessary as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies cross the placenta and can cause foetal problems.

## Question #135

A 32-year-old pregnant woman (26 weeks) presents to her GP because she has been feeling increasingly tired. She is normally fit and well and has had one previous pregnancy which was uneventful. A fasting blood glucose is 5.4 mmol/L. Urine dip is negative and her blood pressure is 134/78 mmHg. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 116 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets | 270 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC       | 7.3 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |

| Na +         | 136 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +          | 3.9 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Bicarbonat e | 25 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |
| Urea         | 6.5 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine   | 89 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |

| ALP      | 170 u/L   | (30 - 100)   |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| ALT      | 20 u/L    | (3 - 40)     |
| Î³GT     | 55 u/L    | (8 - 60)     |
| Albumi n | 37 g/L    | (35 - 50)    |

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Acute cholecystitis
- b) Gestational diabetes
- c) Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
- d) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- e) Normal pregnancy

Correct answer is e.

Normal pregnancy can cause a raised ALP - it doesn't necessarily imply liver problems

The only abnormal finding is a slightly raised ALP. ALP is found in bone, liver, kidney, and intestinal and placental tissue, so ALP tends to rise during pregnancy. In pregnant women levels of up to twice that upper limit can still be normal.

Acute cholecystitis would usually present with abdominal symptoms and right upper quadrant tenderness. It is important to bear in mind that the risk of gallstones increases during pregnancy, as oestrogen can lead to higher cholesterol levels in bile.

Diagnosis (according to NICE) can be made based on either a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L or above, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L or above. Her fasting plasma glucose is below the threshold.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy typically presents with itching (particularly in palms and soles) and can lead to complications for both mother and baby if untreated. LFTs are usually deranged but may be normal on some occasions.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is excessive fat build-up in the liver without another clear cause. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Elevated liver enzymes are common in both but would not typically present with just an isolated rise in ALP. There is also no reason for this young fit woman to have NAFLD.

## Question #136

A 27-year-old female was seen in the general medicine outpatient clinic following a referral by her GP. She had presented to her GP feeling generally tired for the last few months. Her GP organised a blood screen revealing no abnormalities except the presence of a potassium level of 2.8 mmol/l. Her GP subsequently repeated the test four weeks later revealing a level of 2.6 mmol/l, leading to the referral to the clinic. Other than the tiredness she was well in herself, denying all other symptoms. She denied specifically the presence of any cardiovascular and muscular symptoms and had never collapsed. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she was taking no prescribed medication. There was no family history of note.

Examination revealed a well 27-year-old lady. Her blood pressure was 108/78 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm and BMI 23kg/m². Examination of her cardiovascular and respiratory systems revealed the presence of normal heart sounds, a JVP of 3cm and warm well perfused peripheries. Examination of her gastrointestinal and neurological systems was unremarkable.

Investigations conducted at the clinic revealed the following results:

Hb

122 g/l

| Platelet s   |   242 | * 10 9 /l   |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| WBC          |   7.8 | * 10 9 /l   |

## 24 hour urine result:

| Na+   | 28 (NR <20mmol/L if hyponatraemia)   |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| K+    | 45 (NR <10mmol/l if hypokalaemic)    |

## Calciu m

0.8 (NR &lt;7.5 mmol/24hrs)

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Addison's disease
- b) Gitelman's syndrome
- c) Conn's disease
- d) Bartter's syndrome
- e) Laxative abuse

Correct answer is b.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

Gitelman's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a normotensive hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hypocalciuria and is often accompanied with hypomagnesaemia. The defect is in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride symporter within the distal convoluted tubules, in contrast to Bartter's syndrome which presents in the same way but with hypercalciuria owing to a defect within the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with both conditions are often asymptomatic or may complain of fatigue, cramps and weakness. Conn's disease is associated with hypertension and in this instance the aldosterone level is normal with an elevated renin, making this diagnosis unlikely. Both Addison's disease and laxative abuse are associated with a metabolic acidosis; in Addison's serum potassium also tends to be elevated. The best answer is, therefore, Gitelman's syndrome.

## Question #137

A 34-year-old woman calls the endocrinology nurse for advice. She has been vomiting for the last 24 hours and has been unable to take her regular medications. She has a past medical history of Addison's disease. She normally takes oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Apart from vomiting and reduced oral intake she denies any symptoms. Specifically, she has not been dizzy on standing, had any blackouts or any diarrhoea. She has also been having a normal temperature. She has IM hydrocortisone at home.

What is the most appropriate advice to give in regards to her hydrocortisone?

- a) Advise her to come to the emergency department for IV hydrocortisone
- b) Advise her to take the IM hydrocortisone at home whilst vomiting
- c) Advise her to not take any hydrocortisone until the vomiting settles
- d) Adviser her to take IM hydrocortisone only if starting to feel faint or experiencing postural symptoms
- e) Advise her to try and take both IM and oral hydrocortisone

Correct answer is b.

A person with Addisons' who vomits should take IM hydrocortisone until vomiting stops

This is a patient with Addison's disease who is unable to take her regular oral hydrocortisone and is therefore at risk of developing an Addisonian crisis. If unable to take the normal oral hydrocortisone then the patient should be advised to take IM hydrocortisone to avoid this. This is why all patients with Addison's disease should have IM hydrocortisone for these situations. If the patient was unwell with systemic involvement then admission for IV fluids and IV hydrocortisone would be appropriate.

## Question #138

A 42-year-old woman presents with feeling warm and more anxious than usual. She had an upper respiratory tract infection three weeks ago. On examination, you find a new tender goitre.

You send blood tests including thyroid function tests which are outlined in the table below.

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 0.2 mU/L   | (0.5-5.5)   |
|-------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 25 pmol/L  | (9.0 - 18)  |

Given the likely underlying diagnosis, what results do you expect from thyroid scintigraphy?

- a) Globally normal uptake
- b) Globally increased uptake
- c) Globally reduced uptake
- d) Well defined area of decreased uptake
- e) Well defined area of increased uptake

De Quervain's thyroiditis: initial hyperthyroidism, painful goitre and globally reduced uptake of iodine-131

Subacute thyroiditis is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism and a new painful goitre. The investigation of choice is thyroid scintigraphy which reveals globally reduced uptake of iodine-131. Most cases are self-limiting and do not require treatment. The other answers provided are not the most common expected findings for De Quervain's thyroiditis.

Global normal uptake with uniform uptake of iodine-131 is most associated with a normal thyroid gland. Given the abnormal thyroid function and painful goitre, this would be an unexpected result in this case.

Globally increased uptake is most commonly associated with Grave's disease.

A well-defined area of decreased uptake would be most consistent with a cold (hypofunctioning) thyroid nodule. This finding would also not be consistent with the painful goitre or hyperthyroidism noted on blood tests in this case.

A well-defined area of increased uptake would be most consistent with a hot (hyperfunctioning) thyroid nodule.

## Question #139

A 52 year old lady presents complaining of polydipsia and polyuria. She has a background of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and bipolar affective disorder and a strong family history of diabetes - she is unsure which type.

Results show the following:

| Na+               | 131mmol/l                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| urine osmolality  | 287mOsmol/kg (300 - 900mOsmol/kg) |
| plasma osmolality | 287mOsmol/kg (285 - 295mOsmol/kg) |

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this lady's symptoms?

- a) Psychogenic polydipsia
- b) Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH)
- c) Diabetes insipidus
- d) Diabetes mellitus type
- e) Hyponatraemia

Correct answer is a.

Although this lady is biochemically hyponatraemic, this is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms.

With a past medical history of bipolar affective disorder, although not stated in the question, there is a good chance she may be on lithium which predisposes her to developing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However with this diagnosis, we would expect a much lower urine osmolality and a higher plasma osmolality. She would also have a normal to high serum sodium. The opposite would indicate a diagnosis of SIADH (serum hypo-osmolality and high urine osmolality).

The osmolality results here reflect a diagnosis of psychogenic polydipsia with a low urine osmolality and a low end of normal plasma osmolality.

## Question #140

A 40-year-old school teacher presented to the medical assessment unit with a 2month history of polyuria and elevated blood glucose levels. There was no family history of diabetes and she was not currently on any medication. On examination, her body mass index was 22 kg/m 2 with normal general physical and systemic examination. Urine was negative for ketones.

| Blood glucose   | 16.5 mmol/l   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| pH              | 7.40          |
| HCO 3           | 25 mmol/l     |
| Na +            | 140 mmol/l    |
| K +             | 3.7 mmol/l    |

Which one of the following test may be useful in establishing the underlying diagnosis considering her clinical profile?

- a) Oral glucose tolerance test
- b) Serum ferritin and total iron binding capacity
- c) Mitochondrial gene mutation (A3243G)
- d) Anti-GAD antibody
- e) Toxicology screen

Correct answer is d.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood is a subtype of diabetes in which patients may present with phenotypic features of T2DM, while displaying the presence of markers of autoimmunity (anti-GAD antibodies)

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood is a subtype of diabetes in which patients may present with phenotypic features of type 2 DM, while displaying the presence of markers of autoimmunity (anti-GAD antibodies). Most of these patients are in the age group of 30-50 years, may or may not have a normal BMI and may present with elevated blood glucose levels. These patients can be managed initially with oral hypoglycaemic agents, although the β-cell function may decline over months to a few years, necessitating a relatively early requirement for insulin use.

## Question #141

A 55 year-old male presents to endocrine outpatient clinic for investigation of gynaecomastia. On examination he has bilateral growth of breast tissue with palpable glandular tissue around the areolae. His past medical history includes hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive cardiac failure. He drinks 30 units of alcohol per week. His regular medications include: levothyroxine, amlodipine, bisoprolol, lisinopril and spironolactone.

On examination he is of normal stature, there are no peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease or testicular masses.

What is the most likely explanation of his gynaecomastia?

- a) Cirrhosis
- b) Hypopituitarism
- c) Iatrogenic
- d) Klinefelter's syndrome
- e) Idiopathic

Correct answer is c.

The most likely explanation for this gentlemans gynaecomastia given the negative examination findings is a side effect of his current regular medications. There are many drugs that can cause gynaecomastia; in this cause the culprit could be either amlodipine or spironolactone.

## Question #142

A 43-year-old woman attends with a 1-year history of recurrent lethargy, shakiness, slurred speech, and diplopia. Symptoms most commonly develop in the mornings and then resolve after breakfast.

She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, alcohol excess and a functional neurological disorder.

Observations: SpO2 97% on room air, respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute, blood pressure 92/64, heart rate 116 beats per minute, apyrexial

Capillary blood glucose: 5.2

During your review, she becomes shaky and feels unwell. A repeat blood glucose is 2.4.

You send a set of blood tests and then administer 40% dextrose gel. The blood tests are reported as follows:

Insulin

43 pmol/L

(&lt;25)

| C-peptide   | 114 pmol/L   | (<75)    |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Pro-insulin | 23 pmol/L    | (3.6-22) |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Alcohol-related hypoglycaemia
- b) Exogenous insulin administration
- c) Glimepiride use
- d) Insulinoma
- e) Non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome

Correct answer isd.

An elevated C-peptide level following administration of IV insulin can confirm insulinoma

The most likely diagnosis here is insulinoma. This should be suspected in patients with symptoms of hypoglycaemia that improve after eating. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia can be varied and diagnosis of insulinoma can take months to years due to difficult diagnosis.

Insulinoma is correct. An insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumour that secretes insulin, as a result insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide levels are raised.

Exogenous insulin administration is incorrect. Pro-insulin cleavage results in Cpeptide and insulin which are then released from pancreatic beta cells. It is a marker of insulin secretion. C-peptide does not form part of exogenous insulin injections and so would not be raised if insulin was being administered erroneously.

Glimepiride use is incorrect. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea and so can be associated with episodes of hypoglycaemia. It can cause a rise in insulin, Cpeptide, and pro-insulin levels as seen here, however insulin levels would generally not be increased to this degree. To confirm or refute the diagnosis a supervised fast may be appropriate.

Alcohol-related hypoglycaemia is incorrect. Alcohol causes hypoglycaemia by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. In these cases, you would expect to see low levels of insulin and C-peptide in response to low blood glucose levels.

Non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome is incorrect. This is a rare syndrome characterised by post-prandial hypoglycaemia episodes and a normal 72-hour fast. This is usually due to a genetic mutation and pancreatic hyperplasia. You may expect to see elevated insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide, but the differentiating factor here is that the hypoglycaemic episodes commonly occur after meals which would be unusual in insulinoma.

## Question #143

A 66-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with increasing lethargy and confusion. Past medical history includes depression, Barrett's oesophagus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Current medications are sertraline 100mg, lansoprazole 30mg BD, and tamsulosin 400mg. Blood tests are as follows:

| Hb        | 104 g/l      | Na +        | 118 mmol/l    |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Platelets | 168* 10 9 /l | K +         | 4.1 mmol/l    |
| WBC       | 8.7* 10 9 /l | Urea        | 7.9mmol/l     |
| Neuts     | 2.5* 10 9 /l | Creatinin e | 173 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs    | 3.0* 10 9 /l | Eosin       | 0.6 * 10 9 /l |

| Corrected calcium   | 3.01mmol/l   |         |       |
|---------------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Total protein       | 95g/l        | Albumin | 30g/l |

Urinary sodium 7mmol/l Urinary osmolality 100mOsm/kg Plasma osmolality 280mOsm/kg

What is the most likely cause of this patient's hyponatraemia?

- a) Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion due to underlying malignancy
- b) Multiple myeloma
- c) Psychogenic polydipsia
- d) Adrenal insufficiency
- e) Drug-induced syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion

Correct answer is b.

Hyperlipidaemia can cause pseudohyponatraemia

This patient has pseudohyponatraemia secondary to raised protein levels from an underlying myeloma. Raised protein levels and hyperlipidaemia are both important causes to consider when investigating hyponatraemia. These patients have a normal total sodium but concentrations are skewed due to the high volume of lipids or protein.

Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion causes a euvolemic hyponatraemia. Patients have a urinary sodium &gt;20mmol/l with raised urinary osmolality and normal/low plasma osmolality. Psychogenic polydipsia is rare and both urinary and plasma osmolalities are low in these patients. Adrenal insufficiency can cause hyponatraemia but the presence of hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, and raised total in this patient make myeloma the most likely underlying cause.

## Question #144

A 65-year-woman is referred to the endocrinology department by her general practitioner. She complains of 12 months of enlarging hands and feet with an inability to put on her usual rings. She also reports that her facial appearance has changed and complains of persistent sweating and arthralgia. She has no significant past medical history and is on no regular medications.

On examination, it is noted that she has coarsened facial features and frontal bossing. There is macroglossia. Neurological examination reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Her hands and feet appear large and spade-like. There was no synovitis.

## Blood tests:

| Hb         | 138 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets  | 189 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC        | 6.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |
| Na +       | 138 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |
| K +        | 4.2 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |
| Urea       | 5.4 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)                           |
| Creatinine | 89 µmol/L     | (55 - 120)                            |
| CRP        | 4 mg/L        | (< 5)                                 |

An MRI head reveals a large pituitary macroadenoma.

An oral glucose tolerance test is arranged and there is a failure to suppress growth hormone with an oral glucose load.

The patient undergoes trans-sphenoidal surgery to remove the tumour.

Despite this intervention, she complains of ongoing sweating, arthralgia and fatigue.

A repeat MRI demonstrates a small amount of residual tumour that is deemed inaccessible to further surgical intervention.

A repeat IGF-1 remains elevated (35 nmol/L) and there is persistent failure to suppress growth hormone with an oral glucose load.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate management at this point?

- a) Bromocriptine
- b) Cabergoline
- c) Octreotide
- d) Pegvisomant
- e) Radiotherapy

Correct answer is c.

Acromegaly: if patients are not suitable for trans-sphenoidal surgery, or have residual symptoms, then octreotide may be used

Octreotide is the correct answer. This patient has acromegaly, which is the consequence of a growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumour. Clinical features include enlargement of hands and feet, coarsening of facial features and frontal bossing. IGF-1 is raised and the diagnosis is confirmed with the failure to suppress growth hormone secretion with an oral glucose load. Trans-sphenoidal surgery is first-line management in most instances. If there are ongoing symptoms postsurgery like there are in this case, there are a number of options. Repeat surgery may be indicated if the residual tumour is accessible. However, it is not in this case. Therefore medical management is indicated to control the symptoms. Octreotide is an analogue of the hypothalamic release-inhibiting hormone, somatostatin. It results in significant tumour shrinkage although the mechanism of action by which it exerts this effect is unknown. It is the first-line medical treatment in this situation.

Radiotherapy is incorrect. This treatment is reserved for cases that are refractory to medical management.

Cabergoline is incorrect. This medication was historically used in the medical management of acromegaly. However, it is less effective than octreotide and associated with significant side effects like cardiac fibrosis.

Bromocriptine is incorrect. This medication is less effective than octreotide. It is a dopamine agonist like cabergoline and is associated with a similar side effect profile.

Pegvisomant is incorrect. This is a second line option in the UK for those patients who do not respond to either surgery, radiotherapy or somatostatin analogues. It is an analogue of human GH and a highly selective GH receptor antagonist which blocks the peripheral synthesis of IGF-1.

## Question #145

You receive a phone call from a general practitioner regarding a 50 year-old man who has had thyroid function tests performed for a history of weight loss. There is no history of illicitly taking levothyroxine. His results show : TSH 0.01 mIU/L, T4 8.5 ug/dL. You should advise which of the following:

- a) Admit for urgent MRI head
- b) Repeat the bloods and include parathyroid hormone (PTH)
- c) Add on T3 as this may represent T3 toxicosis
- d) Start radio-iodine treatment immediately
- e) Start thyroxine replacement

Correct answer is c.

In approximately 5% of patients with clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism T3 may be elevated prior to T4. This is known as T3 toxicosis.

When both free hormones are normal but TSH is low, the term subclinical thyrotoxicosis can be applied.

Radio-iodine treatment should never be started without discussion with the patient and is only used prior to carbimazole in certain circumstances. An MRI head would be part of the work up for secondary hyperthyroidism. PTH would not be useful in this circumstance and starting thyroxine would not be a good idea! T3 toxicosis is treated in the same manner as T4 hyperthyroidism.

## Question #146

A 24-year-old nurse is admitted after collapsing at the end of a night shift. She is found to have a capillary blood glucose of 1.2mmol/L. Following administration of IV glucose, she recovers quickly.

She undergoes a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which shows a hypervascular lesion within the pancreas which enhances with contrast.

What further finding would be most supportive of the likely diagnosis?

- a) Elevated C-peptide following administration of IV insulin
- b) Low serum C-peptide level
- c) Normal serum proinsulin level
- d) Positive anti-GAD antibodies
- e) Sulphonylurea detectable in urine

Correct answer is a.

An elevated C-peptide level following administration of IV insulin can confirm insulinoma

The correct answer is elevated C-peptide following administration of IV insulin . IV insulin administration should generally suppress endogenous insulin secretion and therefore C-peptide levels should fall. An inappropriate elevation in C-peptide levels should raise the suspicion of an endogenous source of insulin secretion. The CT findings are suggestive of an insulinoma.

Low serum C-peptide level is incorrect. This would be expected in cases of factitious hypoglycaemia related to insulin administration. While this patient's employment would give her access to insulin and may raise suspicion of this, the CT findings suggest an insulinoma is more likely.

Normal serum proinsulin level is incorrect. This would also be expected in a patient with factitious hypoglycaemia, whether related to insulin or sulphonylurea administration. In an insulinoma, we would expect elevated proinsulin levels, especially after a prolonged fast.

Positive anti-GAD antibodies is incorrect. These would be expected in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the absence of treatment, this would present with hyper- rather than hypoglycaemia.

Sulphonylurea detectable in urine is incorrect. In this context, this would be suggestive of factitious hypoglycaemia related to sulphonylurea use. Again, this patient would have access through her employment but the CT findings suggest insulinoma is more likely.

## Question #147

An 82-year-old female presents to clinic with her daughter complaining of a four month of history of urinary incontinence. She explains that she has not previously had problems with continence. Her only past medical history include hypertension and angina. Now, she is incontinent of urine only when she laughs or coughs. At times, she reports sudden urges to urinate at all times during the day, resulting in a leak when she is unable to reach the toilet in time. This is significantly impacted on her sleep as well as it is increasingly frequent at night. The patient has reduced her caffeine intake already and has commenced 'bladder training' recommended by her GP. What additional management would you commence?

- a) Pelvic floor exercises only
- b) Pelvic floor exercises and tolterodine
- c) Pelvic floor exercises and duloxetine
- d) Pelvic floor exercises and desmopressin
- e) Long term urinary catheter

## Correct answer is b.

The question concentrates on the management of an elderly patient with mixed stress incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome. In the context of mixed urinary incontinence, pharmacological therapies should be offered in addition to conservative therapies such as pelvic floor exercises. A long-term catheter in whom persistent incontinence causes skin wounds, the patient requires such significant care that continuous changing of bed linen and clothes would be required, chronic retention with a risk of renal impairment (and inability to selfcatheterise) or if the patient opts for the catheterisation. The 2013 NICE guidelines recommends first line pharmacological treatment for mixed incontinence or overactive bladder syndrome alone is either tolterodine, oxybutynin or darifenacin1. Duloxetine should only be used if the patient does not tolerate first line therapy and is not a candidate for surgery. Desmopressin can reduce nocturia. However, its effects in platelet activation contradicts its use in ischaemic heart disease.

## Question #148

A 32-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with reports of fatigue. She is 30 weeks pregnant with her first child. She has no past medical history and is not on any medications.

Examination reveals a distended abdomen with a symphysis-fundal height that is consistent with gestational age. Foetal movements are noted.

## Blood tests:

| Hb         | 136 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets  | 189 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC        | 4.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |

| ALP        | 145 u/L       | (30 - 100)                            |
| ALT        | 32 u/L        | (3 - 40)                              |

What is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?

- a) Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
- b) HELLP syndrome
- c) Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
- d) Normal pregnancy
- e) Primary biliary cirrhosis

Normal pregnancy can cause a raised ALP - it doesn't necessarily imply liver problems

Normal pregnancy is correct. This woman is 30 weeks pregnant and therefore fatigue is not an unexpected complaint. A raised ALP is common in late pregnancy and is usually of placental origin. In the absence of any other signs or symptoms suggesting underlying liver disease, the most likely explanation is that these findings are consistent with normal pregnancy.

HELLP syndrome is incorrect. This stands for haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets. She does not have evidence of either haemolysis or low platelets. While fatigue is a possible symptom, typically other symptoms are also present including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and backache.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is incorrect. This is typically characterized by itch, which is absent in this case.

Primary biliary cirrhosis is incorrect. While this can cause fatigue and a raised ALP, the median age of diagnosis is 65 and it is relatively uncommon in young people. A placental cause of the raised ALP is far more likely.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is incorrect. This is typically characterized by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The ALT level is typically in the 300-500 IU/L range rather than an isolated rise in ALP. The patient will appear unwell, jaundice is common and there may be disseminated intravascular coagulation.

## Question #149

A 45-year-old gentleman is admitted to the psychiatry ward with a two day history of visual hallucinations. His past medical history is relevant for renal transplant last year, indicated because of membranous glomerulonephritis. He is on an established regime of immunosuppressants.

On examination, there is no evidence of focal neurology. Cranial nerves I to XII are normal, with equal and reactive pupils. There are no cerebellar signs. Plantars are equivocal on the left and downgoing on the right. Abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) is 8/10. An urgent CT head is unremarkable.

Which medication may be implicated as a cause of this patient's presentation?

- a) Mycophenolate mofetil
- b) Azathioprine
- c) Prednisolone
- d) Tacrolimus
- e) Ciclosporin

Correct answer is c.

This patient is likely to be experiencing steroid-induced psychosis, and therefore, prednisolone is the correct answer. Most immunosuppressants have side-effects, and it is important to be aware of common associations. In addition to psychosis, steroids such as prednisolone may cause weight gain, secondary diabetes, osteoporosis and myopathy.

Ciclosporin and tacrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors. Ciclosporin is associated with nephrotoxicity, gum hypertrophy and hirsutism. Tacrolimus may cause tremor and secondary diabetes.

Mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine are both anti-metabolites. Mycophenolate mofetil is associated with mucositis.

Azathioprine is steroid-sparing but can induce rashes, hepatitis and pancreatitis.

## Question #150

A 35-year-old patient presents to the emergency department after being brought in by ambulance. She had recently moved locally but had not yet registered with a GP, and therefore had an interruption in her supply of carbimazole for hyperthyroidism, diagnosed three months earlier. She is currently very unwell, complaining of palpitations. Clinically she has a raised JVP, bilateral crepitations on auscultation and severe peripheral oedema, and has become very breathless, and a temperature of 40.1 degrees C. She is started on oxygen. An ECG demonstrates a heart rate of 170bpm in AF, whilst a chest X-ray shows pulmonary oedema. What is the most appropriate immediate management?

- a) IV propranolol
- b) Propylthiouracil
- c) Aspirin
- d) Refer for emergency thyroid surgery
- e) Potassium iodide

Correct answer is a.

In thyroid storm with IV beta-blockers are a important first-line treatment

This is a patient with likely thyroid storm. The presentation suggests abrupt withdrawal of carbimazole has been the provoking factor, and now she has developed AF and heart failure. The most appropriate action is to rapidly control the heart rate by the use of IV beta-blockers. Propylthiouracil should also be started urgently, but the more critical action is to manage her heart rate. Aspirin may worsen the situation by displacing T4 from thyroid-binding globulin, causing an increase in free T4. Whilst the patient will likely need both potassium iodide and thyroid surgery, neither are as urgent as controlling the heart rate.

## Question #151

A 34-year-old woman presents for the first time as being 12 weeks pregnant. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Her current medication is levothyroxine 100 mcg and recent blood tests reveal a TSH level of 1.0 mU/l.

What is the most appropriate management with regards to her levothyroxine treatment, given her recent diagnosis of pregnancy?

- a) Reduce her levothyroxine dose by an average of 25 mcg
- b) Increase her levothyroxine dose by an average of 100 mcg
- c) Increase her levothyroxine dose by an average of 25-50 mcg
- d) Reduce her levothyroxine dose by an average of 50 mcg
- e) Keep her levothyroxine dose unchanged

Correct answer is c.

In patients currently on levothyroxine who become pregnant, thyroid function tests should be assessed at 6-8 weeks gestation, 16-20 and at 28-32 weeks. During pregnancy, the average thyroxine requirements typically increase by 25-50 mcg. The patient normally returns to their original dose of levothyroxine straight after delivery.

## Question #152

A 70-year-old woman is reviewed in the chronic kidney disease clinic. She also has a history of hypertension for which she takes amlodipine 5mg od and ramipril 10mg od. Her most recent results are as follows:

## Blood pressure today is 128/74 mmHg.

|             | Recent      | 12 months ago   |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Na +        | 140 mmol/l  | 141 mmol/l      |
| K +         | 4.5 mmol/l  | 4.3 mmol/l      |
| Urea        | 11.2 mmol/l | 10.5 mmol/l     |
| Creatinin e | 124 µmol/l  | 114 µmol/l      |
| eGFR        | 39 ml/min   | 43 ml/min       |

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

- a) Start atorvastatin 20mg on
- b) Reduce ramipril to 5mg od and recheck U&amp;Es in 4 weeks
- c) Start simvastatin 40mg on
- d) Increase amlodipine to 10mg od
- e) Check her QRISK2 score

Correct answer is a.

QRISK2 should not be used in patients with chronic kidney diseas (CKD). NICE now recommends that all patients with CKD should take a statin.

Offer atorvastatin 20 mg for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD to people with CKD

-  Increase thedose if a greater than 40% reduction in nonHDL cholesterol is not achieved and eGFR is 30 ml/min
-  Agree the use of higher doses with a renal specialist if eGFR is less than 30 ml/min

## Question #153

A 65-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with polyuria and polydipsia. He has a past medical history of surgically treated bladder cancer, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. His medications include amlodipine, furosemide, atenolol and ramipril.

The examination is unremarkable.

Blood tests:

| Na +        | 137 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +         | 4.2 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea        | 28.2 mmol/L  | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinin e | 312 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |
| eGFR        | 21 ml/minute | (>90)         |
| HbA1c       | 52 mmol/mol  | (<48)         |

What is the most appropriate medication to commence?

- a) Empagliflozin
- b) Insulin
- c) Metformin
- d) Pioglitazone
- e) Sitagliptin

T2DM initial therapy: if metformin is contraindicated (and no risk of CVD, established CVD or chronic heart failure) → choice of DPP-4 inhibitor or Pioglitazone or Sulfonylurea or even SGLT-2 (if NICE criteria met)

Sitagliptin is correct. The patient has symptoms and biochemical evidence of type 2 diabetes with an hba1c level &gt; 48 mmol/mol. Typically, patients would be treated with oral anti-diabetic medications in the first instance. Metformin is the usual choice but it is contraindicated in severe renal impairment. There are a number of other medications that can be chosen depending on the patient's profile. Many of them are contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Sitagliptin is the medication that is most appropriate as it can be started 1st line for T2DM when metformin is contraindicated. It can be started at a reduced dose when the eGFR is &lt; 30ml/minute.

Metformin is incorrect. This is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.

Empagliflozin is incorrect. This is typically not initiated in type 2 diabetes if the eGFR is &lt; 45ml/minute.

Insulin is incorrect. This is not typically used 1st line in with the management of type 2 diabetes as oral medications are typically trialled in the first instance.

Pioglitazone is incorrect. This is contraindicated in those patients with a history of bladder cancer.

## Question #154

A 19-year-old woman presents for review. Her past medical history includes 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency and hypertension, which is managed with ramipril and indapamide. The 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency was identified at birth upon identifying clitoromegaly.

Which of the following is likely to be raised most markedly?

- a) 17-OH pregnenolone
- b) Oestradio
- c) 11-deoxycortisol
- d) 17-OH progesterone
- e) Oestrone

Correct answer is c.

11 beta-hydroxylase is responsible for the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol to corticosterone and cortisol. In patients with 11-betahydroxylase deficiency, this conversion does not occur in sufficient amounts and levels of these steroids accumulate in the patient. Therefore, although 17-OH hormones may also be raised, the 11-deoxycortisol is more significantly raised than the others.

## Question #155

A 65-year-old man is reviewed in clinic. He has a past medical history of an NSTEMI, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and depression. He is euvolaemic on examination. His drug history includes sertraline, bisoprolol, ramipril and furosemide.

Blood results are follows:

| Hb        | 138 g/l        | Na +   | 126 mmol/l   |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Platelets | 440 * 10 9 /l  | K +    | 3.8 mmol/l   |
| WBC       | 10.8 * 10 9 /l | Urea   | 7.2 mmol/l   |

| Glucose           | 6.5 mmol/l    | Creatinine              | 86 µmol/l                  |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Total cholesterol | 6.5 * 10 9 /l | Triglycerides (fasting) | 12.5 mmol/L (normal < 1.7) |

You perform a paired serum and urine osmolarity:

What is the most likely cause of the hyponatraemia?

| Serum osmolarity   | 290 mOsmol/kg (normal 275-295)   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Urine osmolarity   | 600 mOsmol/kg                    |
| Urine sodium       | 40 mmol/l                        |

- a) SIADH
- b) Dilutional hyponatraemia secondary to heart failure
- c) Pseudohyponatraemia
- d) Furosemid
- e) Hypothyroidism

Correct answer is c.

Pseudohyponatraemia is characterised by a normal measured serum osmolarity, however the calculated osmolarity (based on an erroneously low plasma sodium result) is reduced. This results in a raised osmolar gap

Identifying the cause of hyponatraemia can be challenging. The first step is to confirm that it is a true hypotonic hyponatraemia. This is done by measuring the plasma osmolarity.

-  If the measured plasma osmolarity is low this confirms true hypotonic hyponatraemia.
-  If the plasma osmolarity is normal then this is suggestive of pseudohyponatraemia and should prompt you to measure proteins and lipids, which if present in high levels, can cause a pseudohyponatraemia due to the measuring technique.
-  If the serum osmolarity is high then this confirms hypertonic hyponatraemia and should prompt you to check for high levels of solutes in the plasma, hyperglycaemia being the most common.

In this case, the normal measured serum osmolarity suggests pseudohyponatraemia. Pseudohyponatraemia occurs due to a measuring technique defect. Using standard techniques, serum sodium is measured as a ratio of sodium to plasma volume. If the patients plasma has high amounts of proteins or lipids, the plasma volume will be increased resulting in a measured hyponatraemia. This is not a true hyponatraemia as the actual ratio of sodium to plasma fluid will be normal. Common causes include hyperproteinaemia (e.g. TPN, IVIG) and hyperlipidaemia (in particular hypertriglyceridemia).

In this case, the measured serum osmolarity can be compared with the calculated serum osmolarity. The calculated serum osmolarity = 2Na + 2K + glucose + urea = 273.3 mOsmol/kg. The osmolar gap = measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity = 290 - 273.3 = 16.7 (normal &lt;10). A raised osmolar gap is suggestive of the presence of other osmotically active particles. In this case it is due to the presence of a significantly raised triglyceride level.

## Question #156

A 55-year-old woman attends the emergency department with abdominal pain. She complains of right-sided loin pain which radiates to her groin. She is otherwise well. She has a past medical history of Sjogren's syndrome. On examination, you note right-sided renal angle tenderness.

## Blood results are as follows:

| Hb          | 126 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets   | 245 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC         | 6.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |
| Na +        | 136 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |
| K +         | 2.5 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |
| Cl -        | 120 mmol/L    | (96 - 106)                            |
| Urea        | 6.9 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)                           |
| Creatinine  | 56 µmol/L     | (55 - 120)                            |
| Bicarbonate | 14 mmol/L     | (23 - 29)                             |
| Glucose     | 22.5 mmol/L   | (4 - 7)                               |
| CRP         | 2 mg/L        | (< 5)                                 |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Addison's diseas
- b) Diabetic ketoacidosis
- c) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- e) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis

Correct answer is c.

Type 1 ( distal ) renal tubular acidosis may be caused by Sjogren's syndrome

The patient has a metabolic acidosis as indicated by the low serum bicarbonate. The anion gap (AG) is a derived variable primarily used for the evaluation of metabolic acidosis to determine the presence of unmeasured anions. The normal anion gap varies with different assays but is typically 4 to 12 mmol/L.

The anion gap = (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3) = (136 + 2.5) - (120 + 14) = 4.5.

Thus the patient has a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).

Causes of NAGMA include ('ABCD'):

-  Addison's
-  Bicarbonate loss: GI (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)
-  Chloride excess
-  Diuretics (e.g. acetazolamide)

Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) include:

-  Lactate
-  Toxins (e.g. methanol, paracetamol, propylene glycol)
-  Ketones
-  Renal failure

Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is correct. The presence of kidney stones, hypokalemia, NAGMA, and a past medical history of Sjogren's favour the diagnosis of type 1 RTA.

Addison's disease is incorrect. Although this can also cause a NAGMA, hyperkalemia would be expected as a consequence of hypoaldosteronism. Furthermore, patients with Addison's will often be hypoglycaemic.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incorrect. Although the patient is significantly hyperglycaemia and likely has undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, the presence of ketones would result in a HAGMA.

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This can also present with hypokalemia and NAGMA, however, there is not an association with Sjogren's making this a less likely diagnosis.

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although diabetes is a cause of type 4 RTA, this condition would be associated with hyperkalemia in contrast to the hypokalemia demonstrated in this case.

## Question #157

A 55-year-old man presents to the endocrine clinic. He was diagnosed five years ago with type 2 diabetes and is struggling to control his sugars. He is currently taking:

Metformin 1g BD Glicazide 160mg BD Sitagliptin 100mg OD

He is a bus driver and struggles to control his weight with his hectic shifts. Current BMI is 34 kg/m².

Investigations:

Serum creatinine

120 µmol/L (60-110)

Haemoglobin A1c

66 mmol/mol (8.2%)

What would be the most appropriate next step?

- a) Canagliflozin
- b) Glibenclamide
- c) Increase metformin
- d) Stop sitagliptin and add insulin
- e) Stop sitagliptin and add exenatide

Correct answer is e.

Given the NICE guidance the most appropriate step would be to start this patient on exenatide. This patient is already of metformin, glicazide and sitagliptin and the blood sugar levels are not under control. His BMI is under 35 but insulin would make 'it much more difficult for you to do your job'.

## Question #158

A 52-year-old patient is referred to the endocrinology clinic due to excessive sweating, which occurs over several months, and was concerned when the GP was unable to reassure him. On further questioning he has persistent sweating which is out of keeping with his activities, and sometimes develops headaches. He has found this to be a worsening problem over the last months. He has found that he has low energy as well. On examination he has a large face and tongue. He has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

What is the most appropriate first-line investigation

- a) Serum growth hormone
- b) Serum IGF-1
- c) Visual field testing
- d) Oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum glucose

## e) Pituitary MRI

Correct answer is b.

Serum IGF-1 levels are now the first-line test for acromegaly

The most appropriate first-line investigation for this patient is serum IGF-1 . The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of acromegaly, which is caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland. Acromegaly can lead to hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and other complications. Serum IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) levels are a reliable indicator of GH activity and are more stable than serum GH levels throughout the day. An elevated serum IGF-1 level would support the diagnosis of acromegaly.

Serum growth hormone measurement is not the best first-line investigation because GH secretion is pulsatile, with peaks and troughs throughout the day. This can lead to false-negative results if the blood sample is taken during a period when GH levels are low. Serum IGF-1 levels are less variable and provide a more accurate assessment of overall GH activity.

Visual field testing could be useful in assessing potential compression of the optic chiasm by a pituitary tumour causing acromegaly; however, it is not an appropriate first-line diagnostic test for confirming the presence of acromegaly itself. It would be more relevant once biochemical evidence has been obtained to support the diagnosis.

An oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum glucose may be helpful in evaluating a patient's diabetes status but does not directly address the suspicion of acromegaly. In patients with confirmed acromegaly, an oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone may be used to assess disease activity, as normal individuals should have suppressed GH levels after glucose ingestion, while those with acromegaly will not suppress their GH adequately.

A pituitary MRI could potentially identify a pituitary adenoma as the cause of acromegaly; however, it is not the best first-line investigation. Biochemical confirmation of GH excess should be obtained before performing imaging studies.

Once a diagnosis of acromegaly has been established through elevated serum IGF-1 levels and/or an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test measuring serum growth hormone, a pituitary MRI would then be appropriate to identify the underlying cause and guide further management.

## Question #159

A 28-year-old woman presents with daily intractable vomiting. She is 10 weeks pregnant with 3+ ketones in her urine. Initially, she tried cyclizine from her general practitioner with little success. You suspect hyperemesis gravidarum. Apart from rehydration and anti-emetics, what also should be prescribed?

- a) Thiamine
- b) Carbohydrate replacement with 5% dextrose
- c) Niacin
- d) Vitamin B1
- e) Folate

Correct answer is a.

Nausea and vomiting are both common in pregnancy, affecting 50-80% of pregnant women. Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in 0.3-3% of pregnancies. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and other causes of vomiting should be considered: urinary tract infection, endocrine causes (thyrotoxicosis, diabetic ketoacidosis etc), surgical causes and drugs such as iron supplements.

The Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) guidelines state: Thiamine supplementation (either oral or intravenous) should be given to all women admitted with prolonged vomiting, especially before administration of dextrose or parenteral nutrition.

(https:www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/green-topguidelines/gtg69-hyperemesis.pdf)

A 5% dextrose intravenous infusion may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. In addition, patients are frequently hyponatraemic and therefore sodium chloride 0.9% is most appropriate (+/- potassium replacement).

Folic acid (400 micrograms) daily is recommended for all women prior to conception and up to the 13th week of pregnancy. Women who are deemed higher risk of spina bifida are advised to take 5mg daily. This is to prevent neural tube defects but has no role in hyperemesis gravidarum.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is not of clinical concern in this scenario.

Niacin deficiency leads to pellagra. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a self-limiting condition associated with pregnancy and therefore niacin deficiency is not of clinical concern here.

## Question #160

A 64-year-old woman attends the emergency department with heart palpitations. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Observations are as follows: heart rate 92 beats per minute, and blood pressure 145/85 mmHg,

Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 116 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------|

| Bicarbonate  | 12 mmol/L    | (23 - 29)    |
| Glucose      | 34.5 mmol/L  | (4 - 7)      |
| CRP          | 2 mg/L       | (< 5)        |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Addison's disease
- b) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
- c) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- e) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis

Correct answer is e.

Renal tubular acidosis (type 4) causes hyperkalaemia

The patient has a metabolic acidosis as indicated by the low serum bicarbonate. The anion gap (AG) is a derived variable primarily used for the evaluation of metabolic acidosis to determine the presence of unmeasured anions. The normal anion gap varies with different assays but is typically 4 to 12 mmol/L.

The anion gap = (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3) = (136 + 6.5) - (125 + 12) = 5.5.

Thus the patient has a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).

Causes of NAGMA include ('ABCD'):

-  Addison's
-  Bicarbonate loss: GI (e.g. diarrhoea) or renal (e.g. renal tubular acidosis)
-  Chloride excess
-  Diuretics (e.g. acetazolamide)

Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) include:

-  Lactate
-  Toxins (e.g. methanol, paracetamol, propylene glycol)
-  Ketones
-  Renal failure

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is correct. The presence of NAGMA, hyperkalemia, and a history of diabetes favours a diagnosis of type 4 renal tubular acidosis.

Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although this condition also presents with NAGMA, it is associated with hypokalemia.

Addison's disease is incorrect. Addison's can result in NAGMA, with hyperkalemia as a consequence of hypoaldosteronism. However, the presence of hyperglycaemia and hypertension makes this a less likely diagnosis. One would expect hypoglycaemia and hypotension in Addison's.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incorrect. Although the patient is significantly hyperglycaemia, the presence of ketones would result in a HAGMA.

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This condition is associated with NAGMA and an hypokalemia.

## Question #161

A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with dyspnoea. She has a past medical history of type 1 diabetes. She is poorly compliant with insulin treatment. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and lives with her family.

Her observations are heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24/minute, blood pressure 120/77 mmHg and temperature 36.7ºC.

## Arterial blood gas:

| pH         | 7.11       | (7.35-7.45)   |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| pO2        | 14.1 kPa   | (11-13)       |
| pCO2       | 3.4 kPa    | (4.5-6)       |
| HCO3       | 10 mmol/L  | (22-26)       |
| Glucose    | 24 mmol/L  | (< 7.8)       |
| Lactate    | 2.6 mmol/L | (0-2)         |
| Potassiu m | 4.8 mmol/L | (3.5-5.5)     |
| Sodium     | 136 mmol/L | (135-145)     |

She is treated with intravenous normal saline with appropriate potassium replacement and a fixed rate insulin infusion (FRII) with normalization of her academia, ketonemia and hyperglycaemia.

What electrolyte abnormality is she at risk of developing during the resolution of

## this condition?

- a) Hypercalcaemia

- b) Hyperkalaemia

- c) Hypernatraemia

- d) Hypermagnesemi

- e) Hypophosphataemia

Correct answer is e.

Recovering DKA are at risk of hypophosphataemia

Hypophosphataemia is the correct answer. This patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (elevated blood glucose level, acidaemia and ketonemia). A rise in insulin due to exogenous insulin administration causes an intracellular shift of phosphate. There is an element of phosphaturia in addition.

Hypercalcaemia is incorrect. This has been noted to occur in the development of DKA, likely secondary to severe metabolic acidosis and insulin deficiency but would therefore be not expected to occur as DKA resolves.

Hyperkalaemia is incorrect. Most patients with DKA are potassium deficient and the risk is of hypokalaemia, not hyperkalaemia. Furthermore drives potassium into cells, resulting in hypokalaemia.

Hypermagnesemia is incorrect. Insulin administration causes uptake of magnesium into cells and may cause hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia.

Hyperphosphataemia is incorrect. It is low rather than high phosphate that is the risk in recovering DKA patients.

A 53 year old gentleman attends his General Practitioner for a 'Well Man Check'. He has a past medical history of hypertension which has been treated with ramipril for 4 years. As part of the screening the GP notes that the patient has been suffering from low back pain for the last couple of months. He has been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen that he has bought over the counter and this has eased his pain. His blood pressure today is 134/76 mmHg. His GP takes blood tests as part of the check and the results are shown below.

| Hb         | 13.2 g/dl     |
|------------|---------------|
| Platelet s | 312 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC        | 8.2 * 10 9 /l |

| Na +        | 138 mmol/l   |
|-------------|--------------|
| K +         | 6.6 mmol/l   |
| Urea        | 6.2 mmol/l   |
| Creatinin e | 114 µmol/l   |

His GP notifies the patient immediately on seeing these results and refers him to the local Medical Assessment Unit. Where more tests are carried out.

Arterial Blood Gases:

pH 7.34

PaCO2 5.1kPa

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Renal Tubular Acidosis type
- b) Renal Tubular Acidosis type
- c) Renal Tubular Acidosis type
- d) Renal Tubular Acidosis type
- e) NSAID induced nephropathy

Correct answer is d.

This patient has RTA type 4. This often occurs asymptomatically as in this case. In this case it's aetiology is likely secondary to ibuprofen use which has caused an aldesterone resistance in the proximal tubule of the nephron. It is associated with a mild metabolic acidosis and classically presents in patients with a high serum potassium. Urinary pH is commonly normal, but given that the nephron has not lost its hydrogen ion buffering capacity there is scope for the urinary pH to become more acidic to buffer the metabolic acidosis. The serum chloride level is high in this patient, with hyperchloraemia being a cardinal feature of all sub-types of RTA. When calculated, the anion gap in RTA type 4 is normal.

In NSAID induced nephropathy the urinalysis would show white cells (leukocytes) and may even show proteinuria.

## Question #163

A 28-year-old lady has noticed over the last year that she does not tolerate cold weather well. She is fatigued and her partner notices that she is also low in mood despite having no obvious triggers. Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates a sinus rhythm at 43 beats per minute. She has a background of type 1 diabetes mellitus for which she takes insulin. She also has coeliac disease. Her blood results are shown below:

| T4                                 | 5 pmol/L (reference range 9-25 pmol/L)   |

What is the next best step in her management?

- a) Commence levothyroxine
- b) Commence carbimazole
- c) Ultrasound scan thyroid
- d) MRI pituitary
- e) Short synacthen test

## Correct answer is e.

The short synacthen test is the best test to diagnose Addison's disease

Every time you see type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, coeliac, or indeed ANY of the autoimmune conditions in the past medical history of a patient in the exam engage autoimmune mode in your brain. Once you have done that, you will be specifically looking not to miss other coexistent autoimmune conditions they may be trying to hide from you behind a cryptic clinical sign or some subtle blood abnormality. In this example, where she has type 1 diabetes, thinking like that then gives you the diagnosis of an autoimmune hypothyroid cause (Hashimoto's). If you think you have made a diagnosis of Hashimoto's, you should routinely next always look to rule out Addison's, even if the sodium is normal (which it isn't in this example: a subtle blood abnormality). Addison's (just like other autoimmune conditions) may coexist with Hashimoto's. However, the danger of missing Addison's in Hashimoto's is that it sits there masked by the hypothyroid. If you miss it and treat the hypothyroid blindly first without covering the Addison's, you will unmask the Addison's and the patient will come back in an adrenal crisis a few days later.

## Question #164

A 54-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sweating and palpitations. She has a past medical history of Graves disease. She has completed a course of carbimazole approximately six months ago. Her other past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and morbid obesity. She is on metformin, aspirin, amlodipine and atorvastatin.

Her observations are as follows:

-  Heart rate 111 beats per minute
-  Blood pressure 124/72 mmHg
-  Respiratory rate 21/minute
-  Oxygen saturations 96% on room air
-  Temperature 37.1C

On examination, she is diaphoretic and anxious. A tremor is noted. Ophthalmic examination is normal. There is a very small goitre. Her body mass index is 53 kg/kg/m².

## Blood tests:

| TSH     |   0.0 mIU/L | (0.2-5.5)   |

| Free T4 |          42 | (10 - 24.5) |

pmol/L

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the optimal treatment approach to address the underlying cause?

1. Propranolol
2. Propylthiouracil
3. Radioiodine therapy
4. Repeat carbimazole treatment
5. Surgery

Radioiodine therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with a relapse of Graves disease in the absence of contraindications, such as pregnancy and active severe Graves ophthalmopathy

Radioiodine therapy is the correct answer. This patient has a relapse of Graves' disease. Guidelines recommend that in those patients who have a relapse of disease despite a course of antithyroid drug treatment, definitive management should be instituted in the form of radioiodine treatment or surgery. This patient's many medical problems including ischaemic heart disease and morbid obesity make her a significant anaesthetic risk and therefore radioiodine therapy would be preferable.

Surgery is incorrect. This is an option for the treatment of relapsed Graves' disease. However, she would be a high-risk surgical candidate and therefore radioiodine therapy would be preferable.

Repeat carbimazole treatment is incorrect. Definitive management with radioiodine therapy or surgery is preferred in the setting of relapse of Graves' disease.

Propylthiouracil is incorrect. Definitive management with radioiodine therapy or surgery is preferred in the setting of relapse of Graves' disease.

Propranolol is incorrect. This would control some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism without treating the underlying cause.

## Question #165

A 19-year-old pharmacy student is admitted to hospital after collapsing while at work. She denies biting her tongue or becoming incontinent during the collapse and was groggy but alert on coming around. At the time, a first aider measured her blood glucose to be 1.5 mmol/l. The patients mother reports that the patient has had 2 other episodes of collapse.

The students observations include a blood pressure of 127/77 mmHg, pulse of 81 bpm, and oxygen sats of 97%.

What is the best first-line investigation?

1. Glucose, c-peptide and insulin
2. Morning c-peptide
3. Evening c-peptid
4. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen
5. Oral glucose tolerance test

Correct answer is a.

Measuring blood glucose, insulin and c-peptide allows the differentiation between the causes of hypoglycaemic attacks, including insulinoma, insulin or sulphonylurea misuse.

## Question #166

A 23-year-old man is diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus after presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis. His blood sugars are now stable and he is well. What is

## the first-line insulin regime he should be offered?

1. Twice-daily mixed insulin
2. Once-daily mixed insulin
3. Basal-bolus insulin regimen with twice-daily insulin detemir
4. Basal-bolus insulin regimen with once-daily insulin glargine
5. Rapid-acting insulin analogue before each meal with no longer acting insulin

Correct answer is c.

## Question #167

A 24-year-old female presents to the clinic with worsening of fatigue. She states that she has been feeling tired for months. On systematic enquiry she complains of constipation, cold intolerance and dry skin. She has no past medical history of note and is not on any regular medicines. On examination you note that her lying blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg which falls to 95/60 mmHg on standing.

Investigation results are as follows:

| Hb         | 110 g/l        | Na +   | 131 mmol/l   | Fasting glucose   | 7.5 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|--------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 425 * 10 9 /l  | K +    | 5.1 mmol/l   | Bicarbonate       | 19 mmol/l    |
| WBC        | 10.1 * 10 9 /l | Urea   | 10.5 mmol/l  | Creatinine        | 110 µmol/l   |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

1. Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (APS) - type 1
2. Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (APS) - type 2
3. Addison's disease
4. Type 1 diabetes mellitus
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitu

Correct answer is b.

APS type 2 patients have Addison's disease plus either T1DM or autoimmune thyroid diseas

A fasting glucose of 7.5 mmol/l suggests a diagnosis of diabetes. In the absence of diabetic symptoms (e.g. polyuria, and polydipsia), this would need to be repeated to confirm the diagnosis. Alternatively, other tests such as HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test could be used.

The clinical features of constipation, cold intolerance and dry skin are suggestive of hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests should be performed.

The biochemistry (hyponatraemia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis) and postural hypotension are suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.

The unifying diagnosis is autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (APS) type 2. APS type 2 patients have Addison's disease plus either T1DM and/or autoimmune

## Question #168

A 55-year-old male presents to his general practitioner with a 2-month history of sweating, fatigue and daytime tiredness. He attributed his tight wedding ring to 'fluid retention' and in the last 2 weeks, he has been experiencing worsening headaches and deterioration in his vision. He has otherwise no past medical history and does not take any regular medications.

Which of the following findings would be in keeping with the above?

1. Homonymous hemianopia
2. Overbite
3. Positive Tinel's sign
4. Reduced FVC on spirometry

## 5. Dysdiadochokinesia

Correct answer is c.

This is a case of acromegaly which is caused by excessive growth hormone secretion. In adults, the excess growth hormone secretion is usually caused by a benign growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma.

It is often associated with hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea, carpal tunnel syndrome, colonic polyps/malignancies, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias.

1. Homonymous hemianopia: this is false because the visual field disturbance associated with a pituitary tumour is bitemporal hemianopia
2. Overbite: patients with present with underbite, or prognathism
3. Positive Tinel's sign: this is true in carpal tunnel syndrome
4. 4 and 5: these features are not characteristic of acromegaly

## Question #169

A 16-year-old male attends the clinic with steatorrhoea and poor growth. He has a family history of abetalipoproteinemia. He is on no regular medications. On examination you note ataxia and reduced visual acuity (6/12 in the right eye and 6/15 in the left eye).

Investigations are as follows:

| Hb         | 110 g/l        | Na +   | 136 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 380 * 10 9 /l  | K +    | 3.9 mmol/l   |
| WBC        | 10.1 * 10 9 /l | Urea   | 6.6 mmol/l   |

What management will you advise?

1. Reassurance
2. Simvastatin
3. Dietary restriction of fats
4. Ezetimibe
5. Increase fat intake

Correct answer is c.

Treatment of abetalipoproteinemia involves dietary restriction of fats, and highdose vitamin E therapy

Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic condition caused by a mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in deficiencies in apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins are essential in the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons and VLDL. The end results is malabsorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat soluble vitamin (e.g. vitamins K, A, D and E).

Clinical features include steatorrhoea, poor growth, neurological dysfunction, and impaired vision.

Treatment is with dietary restriction of fats, and high-dose vitamin E therapy.

## Question #170

A 34-year-old man of ethnic Indian origin is reviewed in endocrinology clinic. He has type 1 diabetes. He has a twice-daily mixed insulin regime but has poor diabetic control with elevated HbA1c and high blood glucose. He wants to improve his diabetic control but is concerned about increasing his insulin dose or frequency as he is already overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29kg/m 2 .

Apart from increasing insulin, are there any other medical management options to better control his diabetes?

1. No further medical treatment
2. Metformin
3. Gliclazide
4. Acarbose
5. Pioglitazone

## Correct answer is b.

The correct answer is metformin. This is a patient with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Of importance to this case, he is also overweight and is of ethnic Indian origin. Increasing insulin doses is seldom popular due to the side effects. NICE recommends that in overweight people of Indian origin metformin is an alternative to increasing insulin and may be helpful, especially as it would not lead to further weight increase.

## Question #171

A 26-year-old woman presents to the endocrine clinic. She has a background of Graves' disease, previously well-controlled on carbimazole alone. At the onset, she was in atrial fibrillation and she remains on apixaban for this.

In the past month, she has developed a new tremor, palpitations and weight loss. Observations are within normal limits. Her most recent blood results confirm a return to a hyperthyroid state.

A pregnancy test in the clinic is negative and she has no plans to become pregnant. Examination of the eyes is unremarkable but you find a mild goitre on examination.

## What is the best course of action?

1. Add Lugol's iodin
2. Add high dose oral prednisolone
3. Organise thyroidectomy
4. Start radioiodine treatment
5. Switch to propylthiouracil

Correct answer is d.

Radioiodine therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with a relapse of Graves disease in the absence of contraindications, such as pregnancy and active severe Graves ophthalmopathy

The correct answer is start radioiodine treatment . Radioiodine is the treatment of choice for relapse of Graves' disease. The negative pregnancy test and lack of significant ophthalmopathy rule out the most important contraindications.

Add Lugol's iodine is incorrect. Iodine-containing solutions can block the release of T3 and T4. However, the main place is in the treatment of thyroid storms, generally in combination with other agents such as beta blockers and thionamides.

Add high dose oral prednisolone is incorrect. Steroids are mainly used in severe cases such as those with thyroid storm, although the evidence is limited. This patient is symptomatic but with normal observations and no evidence of thyroid storm.

Organise thyroidectomy is incorrect. Thyroidectomy is a very effective treatment option and may be used to treat relapse in some patients but is generally unpopular. However, it is favoured in those with large goitre or contraindications to radioiodine. These include pregnancy or severe eye disease. In the absence of such contraindications, radioiodine would be favoured here. Her anticoagulation would also increase the complexity and risk of surgery here.

Switch to propylthiouracil is incorrect. This patient has relapsed despite appropriate first-line therapy with one thionamide - switching to another drug of the same class is unlikely to offer any benefits.

## Question #172

An elderly male presents with a 2 week history of breathlessness. His past medical history includes diet-controlled type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypothyroidism and depression. His medication list includes levothyroxine, aspirin, simvastatin, ramipril, bisoprolol and citalopram. Observations on presentation to Emergency Department are as follows: respiratory rate 26/min, saturations 94% (on 4 litres oxygen via Venturi), heart rate 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 156/82 mmHg. Auscultation demonstrates crackles at the left base with no wheeze. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is no oedema peripherally.

Blood results on admission are provided below:

| Hb               | 134 g/l        |
|------------------|----------------|
| Platelets        | 172 * 10 9 /l  |
| WBC              | 13.3 * 10 9 /l |
| Na +             | 128 mmol/l     |
| K +              | 5.1 mmol/l     |
| Urea             | 13 mmol/l      |
| Creatinine       | 178 µmol/l     |
| Serum osmolality | 220 mosm/kg    |

Urinary sodium

50 mEq//l

What is the most likely cause of hyponatraemia?

1. Hypothyroidism
2. Chronic kidney disease
3. Addison's disease
4. Salt-losing nephropathy
5. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)

Correct answer is e.

This question demonstrates a common scenario in clinical practice. Management of hyponatraemia first requires clarification of fluid status (clinical hypovolaemia, euvolaemia or hypervolaemia), as differentials are influenced by this. This patient's history, examination findings and haemodynamic parameters are consistent with clinical euvolaemia.

Differentials for euvolaemic hyponatraemia would include hypothyroidism and SiADH. There are no clinical features suggestive of the former. Findings are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia with associated SiADH. This is confirmed by the presence of reduced serum osmolality and high urinary sodium. Measurement of urinary sodium concentration is an useful adjunct in helping to differentiate between hyponatraemia secondary to hypovolaemia and SiADH. With SiADH (and salt-wasting syndrome), the urinary sodium is high. With hypovolaemia, the urinary sodium is typically low.

## Question #173

A 52-year-old female presents with galactorrhoea. On systematic enquiry she reveals that she has been feeling very fatigued recently. She has no past medical history and takes no regular medicines.

## Blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 125 g/l                   | Na +       | 132 mmol/l   |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets | 422 * 10 9 /l             | K +        | 3.8 mmol/l   |
| WBC       | 9.2 * 10 9 /l             | Urea       | 6.4 mmol/l   |
| Neuts     | 6.2 * 10 9 /l             | Creatinine | 41 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs    | 2.4 * 10 9 /l             | CRP        | 4 mg/l       |
| Prolactin | 440 ng/dL (normal 5 - 40) |            |              |

## What investigation will you perform?

1. MRI pituitary
2. Synacthen test
3. Thyroid function tests
4. Toxicology screen
5. No further investigations required

## Correct answer is c.

Primary hypothyroidism can cause hyperprolactinaemia. High leveles of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulate prolactin release

The patient has galactorrhoea secondary to hyperprolactinaemia. From the history there is not much information to narrow down our differential diagnosis which is currently wide. Hypothyroidism is a very common condition and can cause hyperprolactinaemia. High levels of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) seen in primary hypothyroidism stimulate prolactin release. Hypothyroidism can also cause hyponatraemia as seen in this case. Thyroid function tests are therefore the best answer. A pregnancy test should also be considered.

The Synacthen test is used to assess for hypoadrenalism. Hypoadrenalism is not linked to hyperprolactinaemia.

Certain drugs can cause hyperprolactinaemia (e.g. dopamine antagonists). However a toxicology screen would not detect these agents.

## Question #174

A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to confusion, dizziness and weakness. She has had several similar episodes in the past 3 months. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus of 20 years duration, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. Her diabetes is managed with metformin and glimepiride.

Her observations are taken as follows: temperature 37ºC, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Blood tests are taken, and her finger-stick glucose is 2.7 mmol/L. Glucagon IM and 50 ml of 50% dextrose IV are given. She remains confused, and a repeat fingerstick glucose is 2.9 mmol/L. Serum insulin and C-peptide levels, drawn before dextrose administration, are elevated.

Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?

1. Recheck insulin and C-peptide levels
2. Spiral computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen
3. Repeat glucagon IM
4. Observe for 30 minutes and recheck finger-stick glucose
5. Administer octreotide IM

Correct answer is e.

In sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octeotride

This patient has symptomatic hypoglycaemia and elevated insulin and C-peptide levels, suggesting that the cause of her hypoglycaemia is excessive insulin secretion by her pancreas. Injectable insulins do not have C-peptide. There are two possible causes of excessive endogenous insulin secretion: insulinoma and sulphonylurea overdose. In this patient taking glimepiride, the latter is the more likely cause. In sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite the infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octreotide.

Sulphonylurea overdose is treated with bolus dextrose solution. Most patients recover after this intervention. However, since sulphonylureas cause the pancreas to continue releasing insulin, patients are at an increased risk of persistent or recurrent hypoglycaemia. In such patients, 50 to 100 mcg octreotide is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits insulin release from pancreatic beta-islet cells.

Rechecking insulin and C-peptide levels is inappropriate in this case and would lead to unnecessary delays in management. This patient with symptomatic hypoglycaemia needs urgent treatment.

While insulinoma is a possible cause of raised insulin and C-peptide levels, it is rare and quite unlikely in this patient. Moreover, getting a CT scan would delay the management of her hypoglycaemia.

Repeating glucagon administration may control the hypoglycaemia, but it will not address the underlying cause of persistent hypoglycaemia. The best next step is to administer octreotide.

This patient has symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the setting of sulphonylurea overdose. Observing for 30 minutes would worsen her hypoglycaemia and may lead to coma or death.

## Question #175

A lady who is 10 weeks pregnant presents to her antenatal appointment asking for advice regarding gestational diabetes. She is a 31-year-old white woman with a BMI (body mass index) of 28.7. In terms of family history, she has a cousin who has type 1 diabetes mellitus and an aunt who is being treated for breast cancer. She has had two previous pregnancies, the first one she, unfortunately, miscarried at 8 weeks, and the second was a normal pregnancy that she took to term with a birth weight of 4.6kg. Neither of these pregnancies was complicated by gestational diabetes, and the baby is now 2 years old and has not had to be taken to see a doctor other than routine appointments.

What is the most appropriate testing regime for ruling out gestational diabetes in this woman?

1. Oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks pregnant5
2. None - as she has no risk factors for gestational diabetes
3. Oral glucose tolerance test at 12-14 weeks pregnant
4. Self-monitoring of sugars and repeat appointment in 2 weeks
5. HBa1c

Correct answer is a.

This question requires knowledge on the risk factors for developing gestational diabetes and appropriate testing based on risk:

Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:

-  BMI &gt;30kg/m²
-  Previous delivery of a baby over 4.5kg - which qualifies this patient
-  Previous gestational diabetes
-  Family history of diabetes (1st degree relative)
-  Minority ethnic family origin with a high prevalence of diabetes

If any one of these risk factors is present then one should offer testing for gestational diabetes. The gold standard testing for patients with risk factors is 2hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation. If the patient has had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy then early-self monitoring of blood glucose or OGTT as soon as possible after booking could also be used for diagnosis.

A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made if the patient has either:

-  Fasting glucose of 5.6 mmol/L or above OR
-  A 2-h plasma glucose of 7.8 mmol/L or above

## Question #176

A 28-year-old male with a history of epilepsy, for which he is taking carbamazepine and has not had any seizures for the last two years, presents with irritability and nausea for the last 2 weeks. His girlfriend says that he is often confused and seems to be lost most of the time. He takes alcohol occasionally and smokes ten to twelve cigarettes per day.

On examination, he is irritable but conscious and alert. Clinical examination revealed eczema over the face, shins and extensor surfaces of the forearms and a tattoo on the right shoulder. There was no evidence of any peripheral oedema.

Lab reports were as follows:

| Hb   | 150 g/l   |
|------|-----------|
| MCV  | 81 fl     |
| MCH  | 31 pg     |

| WBC              | 9 * 10 9 /l                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Plt              | 250 * 10 9 /l               |
| Urea             | 3.2 mmol/l                  |
| Creatinine       | 75 µmol/l                   |
| 9:00 am Cortisol | 345 nmol/l (170 700 nmol/l) |
| TSH              | 2.4 mU/l                    |
| Total T4         | 102 nmol/l (68 174 nmol/l)  |
| Na+              | 119 mmol/l                  |
| K+               | 4.2 mmol/l                  |

Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial management option?

1. Fluid restriction to 500 - 1000 ml daily
2. Demeclocycline 600 - 1200 mg daily
3. IV hypertonic saline
4. Intranasal desmopressin twice daily
5. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily

Correct answer is a.

The diagnosis in the scenario described above is SIADH secondary to carbamazepine treatment. The findings of eczema are coincidental and have no bearing on the diagnosis. However, in the management the presence of skin lesions such as eczema may pose difficulty in opting for the use of demeclocycline which may cause photosensitive rashes.

The initial treatment option for SIADH is by fluid restriction which, under most circumstances, will correct the biochemical abnormalities in almost every case.

Demeclocycline is indicated if fluid restriction is poorly tolerated or ineffective.

Hypertonic saline is indicated only when the syndrome is very severe, acute and symptomatic.

Intranasal desmopressin is used for the management of diabetes insipidus, and thiazide diuretics are only rarely used as alternative agents in diabetes insipidus.

The causes of SIADH are as follows

## 1. Tumours

-  Small cell CA of the lung
-  Prostate
-  Thymus
-  Pancreas
-  Lymphoma

## 2. Pulmonary Lesions

-  Pneumonia
-  Tuberculosis
-  Lung abscess

## 3. CNS Causes

-  Meningitis
-  Tumours
-  Head injury
-  Subdural haematoma
-  Cerebral abscess
-  SLE
-  Vasculitis
4. Metabolic Causes
-  Alcohol withdrawal
-  Porphyrias

## 5. Drugs

-  Carbamazepine
-  Chlorpropamide
-  Cyclophosphamide
-  Vincristine
-  Phenothiazines

## Question #177

A 32-year-old female presents to the infertility clinic with an inability to conceive. She is overweight, with a body-mass index of 32 kg/m², and has noticed increased hair growth over her face and chest over the last 12 months. Her periods are irregular and she has also noticed a deepening of her voice. An ultrasound of the pelvis has revealed the presence of multiple cysts in both ovaries. She has been treated with cyproterone acetate for her hirsutism but was informed that she should not attempt conception whilst on the drug. She now wishes to conceive.

On examination, she has a cushingoid appearance, with abdominal striae and her blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg.

Laboratory investigations reveal:

| 9:00 am Cortisol   | 710 nmol/l (170 700 nmol/l)   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| LH                 | 28 iU/l (1 20 iU/l)           |
| Basal FSH          | 4.7 iU/l (1.0 8.8 iU/l)       |
| DHEAS              | 509 µg/dl (31 228 µg/dl)      |
| Prolactin          | 602 mU/l (<360 mU/l)          |
| 17 OH Progesterone | 54 ng/dl (<80 ng/dl)          |

Which of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for the treatment of infertility?

1. Metformin
2. Spironolactone
3. Reverse circadian rhythm steroids
4. Clomiphene citrate
5. Cabergoline

Correct answer is 4.

The Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS requires at least two of the following

-  Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism.
-  Evidence of oligo- or anovulation.
-  Presence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to assess which drug is the most appropriate in aiding fertility. An article published in the New England journal of Medicine entitled Clomiphene, Metformin, or Both for Infertility in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome concluded that Clomiphene is superior to metformin in achieving live birth in infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, although multiple birth is a complication(N Engl J Med 2007; 356:551-566 February 8, 2007).

Another article Status of clomiphene citrate and metformin for infertility in PCOS (Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2012 Oct;23(10):533-43) published the following results:

'Though widely used, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness and adverse effects of metformin and clomiphene citrate (CC) for infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A systematic review (SR) of the best available evidence suggests that both CC and metformin are better than placebo for increasing ovulation and pregnancy rates, but CC is more effective than metformin for ovulation, pregnancy and live-birth rates, in PCOS patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt;30.'

In PCOS, serum prolactin may also be marginally raised, but the levels seldom exceed 1500 mU/l.

Reverse circadian rhythm steroids are used in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, whilst cabergoline is used for the medical management of hyperprolactinemia.

Spironolactone has antiandrogenic activity and can cause improvements in hirsutism in PCOS but has no bearing on fertility.

## Question #178

A 78-year-old female attends the diabetes clinic. She has longstanding type 2 diabetes. Over the last few years she has become increasingly frail. Her main complaint is recurrent nausea and vomiting. Earlier this year she underwent endoscopy and gastric emptying studies which confirmed gastroparesis. She has since been started on metoclopramide which has had minimal effect on her symptoms. Her weight has decreased by 10% over the past year with a current BMI of 26 kg/m².

Her HbA1c today at the clinic is 44 IFCC mmol/l (6.2%) having been 60 IFCC mmol/l (7.6%) this time last year.

Her past medical history includes chronic kidney disease stage 3 and aortic stenosis.

Her current therapy is Humulin M3 22 units at breakfast and dinner, metformin 500mg BD, ramipril 5mg OD, bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg OD, aspirin 75 mg OD.

She lives alone and is still driving. She denies the need for carers, however, she has had 3 falls in the past month. She describes particular difficulty getting up in the morning and says her mood can often be low in the mornings.

She checks her blood sugar once daily in the morning with the following results.

Saturday

3.1 mmol/l

Sunday

4.0 mmol/l

Monday

4.1 mmol/l

Tuesday

3.2 mmol/l

Wednesday

14.6 mmol/l

Thursday

3.5 mmol/l

Friday

16.1 mmol/l

What is the correct step in the management of her diabetes?

- a) Change Humulin M3 to a glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist
- b) Stop metformin
- c) Add sitagliptin
- d) Change Humulin M3 to 20 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening
- e) Change Humulin M3 to 30 units once daily

Correct answer is e.

This lady's fasting blood sugars are too low. The 2 high readings raise the concern of overnight hypoglycaemia with reflex hyperglycaemia in the morning. Her recent weight loss will mean her insulin resistance will have decreased (as reflected in her decreasing HbA1c) and she will require smaller doses of insulin. Changing her insulin from a total of 44 units daily to 30 units daily offers protection against hypoglycaemia. Furthermore altering her split of insulin to the conventional 2/3rd in the morning and 1/3rd in the evening reduces the risk of overnight hypos.

The risks of tight glycaemic control in this lady vastly outweigh any benefits. She should be advised to check her sugar more regularly for the short-term and given advice regarding driving. Close follow-up with the diabetic nurses should be arranged until her hypo risk is reduced.

There is no indication for a GLP1 agonist (BMI 26) and metformin should continue (assuming eGFR remains above 30) to allow the reduction in her insulin doses to lowest effective levels.

## Question #179

A 50-year-old woman with a history of Grave's disease is reviewed on the surgical ward some 12hrs after parathyroidectomy. She has begun suffering from episodes of carpopedal spasm and pins and needles affecting both hands and around her mouth. On examination on the ward, her blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats per minute. Her serum calcium is measured at 1.85 mmol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?

- a) Intravenous diazepam
- b) Intravenous calcium
- c) Intravenous magnesium
- d) Oral calcium
- e) Oral vitamin D

Correct answer is b.

Intravenous calcium gluconate is used for the acute management of hypocalcaemia

This patient has symptomatic hypocalcaemia, most likely due to an acute fall in parathyroid hormone after surgery. This is considered a medical emergency and calcium replacement IV is essential:

IV calcium gluconate is administered initially with 20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate in 50-100 ml of 5% dextrose IV, given over 10 minutes with ECG monitoring.This can be repeated until the patient is asymptomatic. It should be followed up with a calcium gluconate infusion where 100ml of 10% calcium gluconate is diluted in 1 litre of normal saline or 5% dextrose and infused at 50-100 ml/hr.

Not intervening with respect to the electrolyte disturbance risks significant sequelae including cardiac arrhythmia, diazepam is therefore not appropriate. IV magnesium is most useful where hypocalcaemia is resistant to correction, and oral interventions would take too long to elevate serum calcium levels.

## Question #180

A 34-year-old woman has been referred to your clinic with weight gain and irregular periods.

Observations: heart rate 95bpm, blood pressure 155/92 mmHg.

MRI head: unremarkable intracranial appearances.

CT thorax abdomen pelvis: fatty changes within the liver with parenchymal heterogeneity, pelvic viscera unremarkable, clear lung fields.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Cushing's disease
- b) Cushing's syndrome
- c) Exogenous steroid use
- d) Hypothyroidism
- e) Pseudo-Cushing's

Correct answer is e.

The insulin tolerance test can be used to distinguish Cushing's syndrome from pseudo-Cushing's

In this case, we have a patient with cushingoid features - weight gain, hypertension, and irregular periods. Her blood tests show macrocytic anaemia and abnormal liver function tests which could be in keeping with alcohol excess. A CT scan showing fatty liver changes adds weight to this assumption. Imaging has not shown any obvious adenoma, ovarian cysts, or gland hypertrophy.

Pseudo-Cushing's is the correct answer. Pseudo-Cushing's is also known as 'physiological hypercortisolism'. This can be a result of pregnancy, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic alcohol abuse, depression, and severe physical stress (e.g. infection, surgery). In these cases, there is physiological over-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to these states. It is difficult to differentiate it from Cushing's syndrome. Features of pseudo-Cushing's include; normal or mildly raised serum cortisol, maintained diurnal variation in serum cortisol, a raised urine free cortisol, and a rise in cortisol levels of &gt;170nmol following an insulin stress test. Some Cushing's symptoms such as striae, easy bruising, and proximal myopathy are not usually seen in pseudo-Cushing's.

Cushing's disease is a particular type of Cushing's syndrome where a pituitary tumour causes high levels of cortisol due to increased ACTH secretion. This can be differentiated from adrenal Cushing's by checking ACTH levels (these would be high in Cushing's disease), finding a pituitary adenoma on MRI brain, CRH stimulation testing (in Cushing's disease you would see a high ACTH level), and inferior petrosal sinus sampling (high levels of ACTH in these samples compared to serum). In this case, Cushing's disease is not the correct answer as MRI scanning did not show a pituitary lesion, we would also expect to see a higher ACTH level.

Cushing's syndrome is a syndrome of cortisol excess. Unlike pseudo-Cushing's, this is not in response to a particular physiological state but is due to an abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In Cushing's syndrome, you would expect to see high serum cortisol and high urine free cortisol, but generally to a higher degree than seen in this case. There would also be a loss of diurnal variation and the rise in cortisol in response to the insulin stress test would be blunted as the sustained hypercortisolism suppressed CRH secretion.

Exogenous steroid use is an important differential, good history taking is extremely important. In exogenous steroid use, we would expect to see low ACTH and low cortisol levels.

Hypothyroidism may present with the symptoms this patient has, but would not explain the abnormal urine free cortisol.

## Question #181

A 45-year-old woman was admitted on the medical take with cardiac-sounding chest pain. She had a body mass index of 34 kg/m 2 . She had type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was treated for stable angina. On discharge, she was keen to know more about obesity and her potential treatment options.

Which of the following is the best treatment option for her obesity at this stage?

- a) Gastric banding
- b) Surgical gastric bypass
- c) Sibutramine
- d) Lifestyle measures (dietary, exercise, and behavioural interventions)
- e) Orlistat

## Correct answer is d.

According to NICE guidelines, the first-line treatment for obesity is a combination of dietary, exercise, and lifestyle interventions

Obesity and being overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Health risks include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, musculoskeletal problems, respiratory problems (obstructive sleep apnoea and asthma), fatty liver, gallstones, and increased risk of some cancers (colon, breast, and endometrial).

According to NICE guidelines, the first-line treatment is a combination of dietary, exercise, and behavioural interventions; pharmacological therapy is recommended if there is failure of first-line interventions. Orlistat should only be used when more than 3 months' use of dietary and lifestyle measures has failed.

## Surgery is recommended if:

-  There is a failure of non-surgical measures (no clinically beneficial weight loss over 6 months).
-  The patient has a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or more, or a BMI of 35-40 kg/m 2 and other significant disease that could be improved if they lost weight.
-  The patient has a BMI greater than 50 kg/m 2 .
-  The patient commits to long-term follow-up which needs to be done under the supervision of a specialist obesity team.

A 19-year-old woman presents to her GP with a 7 month history of weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. The diarrhoea is normal colour and over the last three months she has had roughly 2-3 bowel motions per day. The heart palpitations occur randomly throughout the day and night. She has also noticed that she has recently been getting episodes of feeling very hot and sweaty. She has no other past medical history and her only family history is a mother who has Hashimotos thyroiditis.

On examination, the patient is sweaty and her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse is 102 bpm and regular, respiratory rate is 16/min and her oxygen SATs are 98% on air.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

| Hb                                | 135 g/l       |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Platelets                         | 220 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC                               | 7.1 * 10 9 /l |
| Na +                              | 139 mmol/l    |
| K +                               | 3.9 mmol/l    |
| Urea                              | 5.1 mmol/l    |
| Creatinine                        | 60 µmol/l     |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 28 pmol/l     |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 0.08 mu/l     |

A thyroid radioisotope scan is performed and reveals a globally reduced uptake.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Graves disease

- b) Thyrotoxicosis factitial

- c) Hashimotos disease

- d) De Quervains thyroiditis

- e) Atrophic thyroiditis

Correct answer is b.

The most like likely diagnosis in this case is thyrotoxicosis factitia. This is evidenced by the reduced thyroid uptake on radioisotope scanning, along with the fact she may have easy access to thyroxine he mother would be taking it for her Hashimotos thyroiditis. De Quervains thyroiditis can present with symptoms similar to factitious thyroiditis and a decreased uptake on radioisotope scan, however, the fact the symptom shave lasted for 7 months makes this diagnosis unlikely.

## Question #183

A 41-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with acute epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to her back. She has nausea but has not vomited. A diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is suspected and she is commenced on intravenous fluids. Her observations include a blood pressure of 129/72 mmHg, pulse of 88 bpm, and oxygen sats of 97%.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

Hb

13.9 g/l

| Platelets       | 194 * 10 9 /l   |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| WBC             | 8.6 * 10 9 /l   |
| Na +            | 139 mmol/l      |
| K +             | 4.2 mmol/l      |
| Urea            | 4.1 mmol/l      |
| Creatinine      | 92 µmol/l       |
| Bilirubin       | 10 µmol/l       |
| ALP             | 39 u/l          |
| ALT             | 34 u/l          |
| γGT             | 44 u/l          |
| Albumin         | 48 g/l          |
| Triglycerides   | 12.1 mmol/l     |
| HDL cholesterol | 1.1 mmol/l      |
| LDL cholesterol | 3.5 mmol/l      |

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patients condition?

- b) Fenofibrate
- c) Lovastati
- d) Ezetimibe
- e) Alirocumab

Correct answer is b.

Fibrates are the most effective drug for treating hypertriglyceridaemia

The diagnosis is hypertriglyceridaemia, which has caused this patients acute pancreatitis. Fibrates are the treatment for hypertriglyceridaemia at high enough levels to cause acute pancreatitis.

## Question #184

A 34-year-old woman is referred to endocrinology clinic for assessment after reporting symptoms of heat intolerance, tremors and diarrhoea to her General Practitioner. Blood tests in primary care showed evidence of thyrotoxicosis. Further assessment at clinic revealed the symptoms had been present for approximately 4 weeks. The patient had initially attributed the symptoms to the stress of caring for her new baby, who had been born 6 weeks previously. She denied any symptoms of pain on eye movements, diplopia or skin rashes.

Past medical history included only her recent pregnancy with delivery by vaginal delivery. The patient took no regular medications. There was no family history of thyroid disorders. Prior to taking maternity leave, the patient worked as a lawyer. She did not drink or smoke.

Examination revealed a small, diffuse and mildly tender goitre with no evidence of thyroid bruit. There was fine tremor of outstretched hands but no exophthalmos or proptosis. Investigations requested following clinic review are listed below.

Thyroid stimulating hormone

0.1 microU / L (reference 0.4-5.0)

T4 free serum

19.5 pmol / L (reference 8.5-15.2)

| T3 free serum                  | 8.1 pmol / L (reference 3.5-6.5)   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Thyroid peroxidase antibodies  | 250 mU/ L (reference < 150)        |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate | 21 ml / h                          |

Thyroid scintiscanning (Technitium-99): no significant thyroid uptake

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Graves' disease
- b) Toxic thyroid nodule
- c) Viral thyroiditis
- d) Toxic multinodular goitre
- e) Post-partum thyroiditis

Post-partum thyroiditis is associated with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies but no significant uptake on thyroid scintiscanning and is, therefore, the correct answer in this case given that symptoms began approximately two weeks postpartum.

Viral thyroiditis is usually associated with an elevated ESR and negative antithyroid antibodies. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goitre and a toxic thyroid nodule would be associated with different patterns of uptake on thyroid scintiscanning.

Question #185

A 27-year-old woman who is 11 weeks pregnant comes for review. This is her second pregnancy. During her first pregnancy she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes which resolved following the birth of her son. What is the most appropriate management at this stage?

- a) Perform an oral glucose tolerance test
- b) Advise on a diabetic diet and start metformin at 20 weeks
- c) Arrange a fasting glucose
- d) Arrange a HbA1c test
- e) Advise on a diabetic diet and start insulin at 20 weeks

Correct answer is a.

## Question #186

A 22-year-old Asian woman with a body mass index of 24 kg/m² presents with new onset acne, hirsutism, and weight gain. Upon further questioning, it is found that she has had irregular periods for the last two years. On examination, there is mild acne and thick hair growth on her chin and areola region. Abdominal exam is unremarkable.

What are the most likely biochemical results given the clinical findings?

- a) Raised testosterone, low LH/FSH ratio, insulin resistance
- b) Low testosterone, low LH/FSH ratio, insulin resistanc
- c) Low testosterone, raised LH/FSH ratio, insulin resistance
- d) Raised testosterone, raised LH/FSH ratio, increased insulin sensitivity
- e) Raised testosterone, raised LH/FSH ratio, insulin resistance

Correct answer is e.

The clinical description is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This presents with hirsutism, acne, oligo/amenorrhoea and subfertility. Biochemical findings in PCOS include insulin resistance, raised testosterone, raised LH/FSH ratio, raised prolactin and low HDL.

## Question #187

A 57-year-old female presents after noticing a lump in her neck. She reports it being non-tender and she is only concerned about it for cosmetic purposes. She reports no other symptoms. Her past medical history includes hypertension and constipation. Her current medications include ramipril, irbesartan, amlodipine and furosemide. No family history is unavailable. On examination, her neck lump is hard, non-tender and measures 2cm by 1 cm, moves with swallowing but not with tongue protrusion. Her heart rate is 84 beats/min and blood pressure 213/130 mmHg. Examination of her joints was unremarkable with no excessive laxity.

Her blood tests are as follows:

| Hb               | 112 g/l       |
|------------------|---------------|
| Platelets        | 349 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC              | 7.2 * 10 9 /l |
| Na +             | 138mmol/l     |
| K +              | 4.2 mmol/l    |
| Urea             | 6.9 mmol/l    |
| Creatinine       | 72 µmol/l     |
| Adjusted calcium | 3.1 mmol/l    |
| Phosphate        | 0.40 mmol/l   |

She undergoes an outpatient ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of her neck lump. After her procedure, the recovery nurses were concerned regarding her persistent hypertension and the patient is admitted for further investigation. She develops a mild headache with no visual disturbances, resolving on its own after her blood pressure falls to 182/101 mmHg two hours later. Urinary metanephrine collection was positive.

Which investigation is likely to produce the underlying diagnosis?

- a) Genetic testing for RET mutation
- b) Genetic testing for germline VHL mutation
- c) Genetic testing for NF2 mutation on chromosome
- d) CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast
- e) Urinary calcium collection

Correct answer is a.

The clinical collection of phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism should raise suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a, which is a genetic syndrome of near 100% penetrance caused by a mutation of the RET oncogene. The addition of a thyroid lump makes this scenario more suggestive of MEN 2, with medullary thyroid carcinoma completing the diagnosis. MEN2b is subtly differentiated from MEN2a by the lack of hyperparathyroidism and Marfanoid features. Unlikely MEN 1, genetic screening of family members for hyperparathyroidism and germline mutation is useful for long-term surveillance and monitoring. VHL and NF 2 mutations refer to von-Hippel Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 2 respectively: VHL presents classically as a combination of retinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas and phaeochromocytomas while NF2 typically present with intracranial tumours, bilateral Schwannomas almost in all patients.

## Question #188

A 60-year-old woman had a thyroid function test requested by her General Practitioner after reporting some symptoms of mild lethargy. This had unexpectedly demonstrated a suppressed Thyroid Stimulating Hormone level (0.25 microU / L) but normal free T4 level (14.1 pmol / L). She denied any heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea, hair or skin changes, palpitations or eye symptoms.

The patient had a hysterectomy without oophorectomy at age 45 as a treatment for menorrhagia secondary to fibroids. She remembers reaching menarche at around the age of 13 or 14 years. There is no significant family history of coronary artery disease. The patient reported that her mother had suffered a fractured neck of femur at the age of 75 years following a fall. The patient was a retired school teacher with an active lifestyle. She had never smoked and drank very little alcohol.

Examination showed no evidence of a goitre, no fine tremor and no lid lag. External examination of the eyes was unremarkable. The cardiovascular and respiratory examination was unremarkable.

The GP requested some further basic investigations and then repeated blood tests 2 months after the original test. At this time, the patient reported her previous symptoms of lethargy had improved; with hindsight, she attributed this to grief due to the recent death of a close friend.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: average blood pressure 125 / 75 mmHg

ECG: sinus rhythm at 75 bpm; normal axis; no abnormality of QRS, ST interval or T waves.

- a) DEXA scan
- b) Thyroid ultrasound
- c) Start treatment with simvastatin
- d) Radioiodine therapy
- e) Treat with propylthiouracil

Correct answer is a.

The patient has subclinical hyperthyroidism with persistently suppressed TSH levels but normal serum thyroid hormone levels and with no clinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis. This usually occurs in the setting of thyroid overactivity due to Graves' disease or autonomously functioning thyroid nodules sufficient to suppress pituitary TSH secretion but insufficient to cause an elevation of circulating hormones. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism occurs in 1-3 % of elderly patients per year.

The main risk of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the increased risk of atrial fibrillation and hip fractures. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends that treatment is considered in patients with a persistently low TSH level if they are older than 65 years or are at risk of osteoporosis or heart disease.

This patient has a low level of cardiac risk factors with a low-risk lipid profile. Assessment of her osteoporosis risk is complicated by her hysterectomy preventing knowledge of her age at menopause. Therefore, a DEXA scan is appropriate next line management to quantify her osteoporosis risk and inform the decision as to whether or not to treat the sub-clinical hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid ultrasound would not influence the decision to treat at this stage and so is not required.

## Question #189

A 65-year-old man attends with a hot swollen right toe. On examination there is swelling over the MTP joint of the right toe. There is reduced range of movement and it is hot, swollen and painful to touch. He has a past medical history of alcohol excess. He takes no regular medications.

An aspirate of the joint fluid is as follows:

The patient is intolerant of NSAIDs and colchicine. You therefore start a trial of prednisolone. Unfortunately the patient develops steroid induced psychosis.

What agent will you consider prescribing?

- a) Canakinumab
- b) Ibuprofen
- c) Naproxen
- d) Paracetamol
- e) Allopurinol

Correct answer is a.

Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-1 beta receptor binding. It can be used for treatment of acute gout has not responded adequately to treatment with NSAIDs or colchicine, or who are intolerant of them

Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-1 beta receptor binding. It can be used for treatment of acute gout has not responded adequately to treatment with NSAIDs or colchicine, or who are intolerant of them.

The patient is intolerant of NSAIDs therefore ibuprofen and naproxen would be inappropriate.

Paracetamol is a simple analgesic and unlikely to control the patients pain. In addition, the inflammatory nature of gout warrants the use of a drug which reduces inflammation.

Allopurinol is indicated for recurrent gout. It should not be initiated in the acute setting as doing so can prolong the duration and severity of the gout.

## Question #190

A 19-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes is brought to the Emergency department with nausea and vomiting. there is no history of diarrhoea. She also has coeliac disease. She follows a gluten free diet and takes a basal bolus insulin regime with a usual HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol. On examination her blood pressure is 100/80 mmHg with a postural drop of 20 mmHg. Pulse is 88 beats per minute and regular. She looks dehydrated and tanned, she puts her tan down to weeks in the garden after her exams.

## Investigations

| Hb         | 102 g/l        | Na +       | 129 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 189 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 5.0 mmol/l   |
| WBC        | 10.9 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 9.9 mmol/l   |
| Neuts      | 6.2 * 10 9 /l  | Creatinine | 113 µmol/l   |
| Lymphs     | 1.1 * 10 9 /l  | CRP        | 42 mg/l      |
| Eosin      | 1.5 * 10 9 /l  |            |              |

Which of the following is the most important intervention with respect to her management?

- a) Fluid restriction
- b) IV anti-emetic
- c) IV hydrocortisone
- d) IV normal saline
- e) NG feeding

## Correct answer is c.

In a patient with type 1 diabetes, such tight glycaemic control with hypoglycaemia would be considered very unusual. Coupled with the easy tanning, nausea, vomiting, and postural drop in blood pressure, this is highly suggestive of possible Addison's disease. The slight rise in eosinophil count, anaemia, hyponatraemia and potassium at the upper end of the normal range, all support the diagnosis.

In this situation corticosteroid replacement is crucial, without it normal saline replacement alone won't correct any hypotension, nor will it improve hyponatraemia. Although anti-emetics and NG feeding may be useful in restoring this patient to health, they won't correct underlying adrenal insufficiency.

## Question #191

A 45-year-old man attends his general practitioner for an annual review of his diabetes for which he takes metformin. He had an NSTEMI three months and has been commenced on aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol and ramipril.

Blood tests 6 months ago:

HbA1c

mmol/mol

What is the correct management of type 2 diabetes in this patient at this point?

- a) Add empagliflozin

- b) Add gliclazide

- c) Add pioglitazone

- d) Add sitagliptin

- e) No changes to current treatment

Correct answer is a.

In patients with T2DM, SGLT-2 should be introduced at any point they develop CVD, a high risk of CVD or chronic heart failure

Add empagliflozin is correct. While this patient has well-controlled diabetes on metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be introduced if at any point they developed cardiovascular disease (CVD). As he has had a recent NSTEMI, empagliflozin should be commenced.

Add gliclazide is incorrect. The patient has well-controlled diabetes and so the addition of gliclazide is not warranted.

Add pioglitazone is incorrect. The patient has well-controlled diabetes and so the addition of pioglitazone is not warranted. Additionally, you may be cautious about the possibility of heart failure in this patient.

Add sitagliptin is incorrect. The patient has well-controlled diabetes and so the addition of sitagliptin is not warranted.

No changes to current treatment is incorrect. While the HbA1c is well controlled, if at any point the patient develops CVD, an SGLT-2 inhibitor should be added.

Question #192

An 18-year-old man comes to the endocrinology clinic for review. He has been transferred from the paediatric clinic with a diagnosis of congenital hypoparathyroidism and is treated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. He has had one episode of symptomatic renal stones over the past 3 years and his creatinine is elevated at 125 micromol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate target with respect to serum calcium?

- a) 1.85 mmol/l
- b) 2.10 mmol/l
- c) 2.25 mmol/l
- d) 2.60 mmol/l
- e) 2.85 mmol/l

Correct answer is b.

This 18-year-old man is at risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia because of congenital hypoparathyroidism, although elevating his calcium too much with vitamin D supplementation runs the risk of symptomatic renal stones. As such guidelines recommend aiming towards a calcium just below the lower end of the normal range and 2.10 is an appropriate target for serum calcium.

1.85 mmol/l is considered too low and puts the patient at risk of muscle weakness, paresthesias, tetany and cardiac arrhythmia. Maintenance of calcium either at the upper end of the normal range, (2.60 mmol/l), or 2.85 mmol/l (above the normal range), is associated with symptomatic renal stones and progressive deterioration in renal function.

## Question #193

A 22-year-old student comes to the Emergency department with a cough productive of rusty coloured sputum. She has been suffering from increased shortness of breath, night sweats and fevers for the past 48 hours. Current medication includes daily hydrocortisone for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and the combined oral contraceptive pill. Current bloods are shown below:

| Hb         | 131 g/l        | Na +       | 134 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 201 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 4.1 mmol/l   |
| WBC        | 14.9 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 7.0 mmol/l   |
| Neuts      | 10.1 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine | 82 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs     | 1.2 * 10 9 /l  | CRP        | 185 mg/l     |
| Eosin      | 0.4 * 10 9 /l  |            |              |

Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage her steroid hormone replacement?

How should you manage her steroid replacement?

- a) Convert to 200mg hydrocortisone IV BD
- b) Increase the daily dose by 50%
- c) Increase the daily dose by 100%
- d) Reduce the daily dose by 50%
- e) Keep the daily dose the same

## Correct answer is c.

Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who are managed with steroid hormone replacement should be managed in the same way as patients with Addison's disease. In other words, during a period of significant acute infection like the pneumonia here, the dose of corticosteroid should be doubled.

With the patient able to swallow, having presented early with her pneumonia, switching to IV hydrocortisone would represent excess steroid replacement and is not appropriate here. The other options including only small increases in steroid dose, reductions or maintaining the status quo, run the risk of adrenal crisis.

## Question #194

A 47-year-old man attends a diabetes follow-up appointment after being started on metformin 500mg TDS. His most recent HbA1c is 48mmol/mol and he has not been troubled by hypoglycaemia.

His past medical history includes atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. He takes apixaban, bisoprolol, atorvastatin, and ramipril.

What would be the most appropriate course of action regarding his diabetic treatment?

- a) Add in dapagliflozin
- b) Add in glimepiride
- c) Add in sitagliptin
- d) No changes to current medications
- e) Reduce metformin dose

Correct answer is a.

In patients with T2DM, SGLT-2 should be introduced at any point they develop CVD, a high risk of CVD or chronic heart failure

The stem describes a patient with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and a background of heart failure. He is also on apixaban for atrial fibrillation and so at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. All patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant high risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic heart failure, or new cardiovascular disease, should be commenced on an SGLT-2 inhibitor once established on metformin if there are no contraindications.

Add in dapagliflozin is correct. Patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease should be started on an SGLT-2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin.

Add in glimepiride is incorrect. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, these drugs work by increasing insulin secretion and can be helpful for patients with symptomatic, recurrent hyperglycaemia. It can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.

Add in sitagliptin is incorrect. Sitagliptin is a DDP-4 inhibitor and can be used as an adjunct if HbA1c targets are not being met, however, in this case, our patient is meeting his HbA1c target.

Reduce metformin dose is incorrect, the current metformin dose is maintaining a good HbA1c and the patient is not troubled by hypo or hyperglycaemia. There would be no indication to reduce the dose in this case.

No changes to current medications would be appropriate if this patient had not developed atrial fibrillation. Due to the development of atrial fibrillation, his cardiovascular risk is much increased and as a result, the current best practice is to add in an SGLT-2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin.

## Question #195

A 55-year-old male presented to his general practitioner with a 4-month history of sweating, fatigue and daytime tiredness. He attributed his tight rings to 'fluid retention' and has been experiencing worsening headaches and deterioration in his vision.

He was diagnosed with acromegaly and underwent surgery for this condition 1 month ago. He has been feeling well since and has not experienced any new symptoms.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful for monitoring the effect of his therapy?

- a) MRI pituitary
- b) Echocardiography
- c) Growth hormone levels
- d) Insulin-like growth factor levels
- e) Oral glucose tolerance test

Correct answer is d.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) have a long half-life and so is a useful measurement to assess growth hormone secretion and therefore screen for acromegaly and monitor the response to therapy. Serum IGF-1 is the most feasible parameter to assess clinical disease activity, in everyday practice in the outpatient clinic setting. It is monitored every 6 months, and growth hormone (GH) levels are done yearly.

Note: Oral glucose tolerance test (plus GH levels) is not helpful for patients receiving somatostatin analogues, and for patients receiving GH receptor antagonist therapy, only IGF-1 should be measured.

## Question #196

A 75-year-old lady presents to the acute medical unit. She is referred by her GP who is concerned that she has been exposed to the chicken pox virus. Her grandson currently has a generalised vesicular rash and she had been in contact with him earlier that day. Her past medical history includes heart failure and giant cell arteritis. Her current medications include prednisolone, ramipril and bisoprolol. She has been taking prednisolone 40mg for the past two weeks.

How will you manage this patient?

- a) Intravenous ganciclovir
- b) Intravenous acyclovir
- c) Oral acyclovir
- d) Check Varicella Zoster antibodies
- e) Varicella Zoster immunoglobulin

Correct answer is d.

Any patient who is taking 40 mg or more of prednisiolone for more than 7 days or who is taking 20 mg or more of prednisolone for more than 14 days is classed as immunocompromised

Varicella Zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) prophylaxis is recommended for individuals who fulfil all of the following three criteria:

-  1. Significant exposure to chickenpox or herpes zoster
-  2. A clinical condition that increases the risk of severe varicella; this includes immunosuppressed patients, neonates and pregnant women
-  3. No antibodies to Varicella Zoster (VZ) virus

Any patient who is taking 40 mg or more of prednisolone for more than 7 days or who is taking 20 mg or more of prednisolone for more than 14 days is classed as immunocompromised.

This patient is therefore immunosuppressed and has been exposed to the VZ virus. Antibodies to VZ virus should, therefore, be checked so that VZ immunoglobulin can be administered if the patient is seronegative.

Primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection or chickenpox is typically a benign illness in immunocompetent individuals. However, the risk of life-threatening complications, such as disseminated VZV and pneumonitis, is greater in immunosuppressed individuals, with significant rates of mortality.

## Question #197

A 22-year-old man presents with excessive thirst and urination. He has a strong family history of diabetes. His BMI is 20.5 kg/m².

Blood results are as follows:

Which mutation is associated with the best response to low-dose sulphonylureas?

- a) Glucokinase
- b) HNF1A mutation
- c) HNF1B mutation
- d) HNF4A mutation
- e) PDX1 mutation

Correct answer is b.

MODY associated with HNF1A often respond well to treatment with low-dose sulfonylureas

The patient most likely has a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) given his raised blood glucose, young age, strong family history of diabetes, and normal BMI.

HNF1A mutation is correct. MODY associated with HNF1A often responds well to treatment with low-dose sulfonylureas.

Glucokinase is incorrect. This mutation is associated with MODY 2. This subtype has a low rate of complications and often does not need treatment.

HNF1B mutation is incorrect. This subtype does not respond favourably to sulphonylureas.

HNF4A mutation is incorrect. Although patients with this subtype may also respond favourably to sulphonylureas, the response is usually less marked compared to HNF1A mutations.

PDX1 mutation is incorrect. This subtype does not respond favourably to sulphonylureas.

## Question #198

A 22-year-old female, who is known to have type 1 diabetes mellitus, presents with weight loss, anorexia and fatigue for the last six months.

Her diabetes was well controlled with soluble insulin three times daily and long acting insulin in the evening but during the last six months she noticed that her insulin requirement has generally decreased and on three occasions she had hypoglycaemic attacks.

During the same time period she had lost approximately 7 Kg in weight and had generally lost her appetite. She had also been amenorrhoeic over the last three months.

On examination, she is thin (BMI 18), with a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg with a postural drop.

Investigations reveal:

| Serum sodium     | 125mmol/L           |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Serum potassium  | 5.3mmol/L           |

| HbA1c            | 6.0%                |
| Serum free T4    | 7.5 pmol/L          |
| Serum TSH        | 5.5 pmol/L          |
| Serum oestradiol | 70 pmol/L (130-850) |
| Serum LH         | 2.5 mU/L (2-10)     |
| Serum FSH        | 2.2 mU/L (2-10)     |
| Serum prolactin  | 400 mU/L (50-450)   |
| Serum calcium    | 2.9 mmol/l          |
| Serum phosphate  | 0.8 mmol/l          |

What is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?

- a) Thyroid autoantibodies
- b) PTH concentration
- c) Short synacthen test
- d) Pregnancy test
- e) Random cortisol concentration

Correct answer is c.

This known type 1 diabetic female has developed Addisons disease on top of her diabetes. This explains the hypoglycaemic attacks, the decrease in her insulin requirement, the fatigue and weight loss.

Both type 1 DM and Addisons disease are features of Schmidt's disease (type 2 autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome) which is the diagnosis in this case.

The low T4, raised TSH, high calcium, low FSH, low LH, low oestradiol (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) are all features of Addisons disease.

The best investigation to diagnose Addisons disease is the short synacthen test. It is of paramount importance when treating these patients is not to replace thyroxine before hydrocortisone because this will induce Addisonian crisis.

## Question #199

A 34-year-old man is admitted after being found at home covered in his vomit and excrement. He is a known alcoholic and has not been seen for two weeks.

On examination, he is drowsy and complaining of generalised aches and pains.

An ECG shows prolonged PR interval and prolonged QTc of 620ms.

On examination JVP is not visible, his mucus membranes are dry, and his eyes are sunken. His chest is clear, his heart sounds normal, and his abdomen soft and nontender. There is moisture damage to his buttocks.

## CT head is unremarkable.

Blood tests are completed and results are detailed below:

| Calcium   | 1.9 mmol/L   | (2.1-2.6)   |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Phosphate | 0.6 mmol/L   | (0.8-1.4)   |
| Magnesium | 0.4 mmol/L   | (0.7-1.0)   |

What is the priority in the management of this man's electrolyte disturbances?

- a) Replace magnesium intravenously
- b) Replace potassium intravenously
- c) Start insulin-dex infusion
- d) Start oral magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium
- e) Start telemetry

Correct answer is a.

Replace magnesium before correcting hypokalaemia. Hypomagnesemia prevents potassium absorption

In this question, the patient has multiple electrolyte abnormalities due to poor oral intake over the preceding 2 weeks.

Intravenous magnesium replacement would be recommended in this case due to the severity of magnesium deficiency. Severe hypomagnesaemia is defined as levels &lt;0.4 mmol/L.

Although we do need to replace potassium intravenously , hypomagnesemia prevents potassium absorption, so we need to correct this before supplementing potassium.

Dex-saline can be used as part of the treatment of hyperkalaemia. It does not necessarily need to be used in hypokalaemia.

Start oral magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium : this man has severe hypomagnesaemia (&lt;0.4 mmol/L) and severe hypokalaemia (&lt;2.5 mmol/L). He requires intravenous replacement and oral supplementation is not appropriate.

Telemetry would be required, but it is not the main priority here, electrolyte replacement should not be delayed in this case whilst awaiting telemetry.

## Question #200

A 39-year-old woman has undergone a total thyroidectomy for a papillary thyroid tumour which was 3.2cm in size without lymph node or metastatic involvement and negative margins. She is reviewed in the endocrinology clinic following her treatment and would like to know how best she should be monitored for recurrence of malignancy. What is the most appropriate monitoring?

- a) Annual CT neck

- b) Annual US neck

- c) Annual MRI neck

- d) Annual thyroglobulin

- e) Annual TSH and free T

Following surgery and radioiodine therapy, patients with papillary thyroid cancer should be monitored with thyroglobulin annually

This patient has a very good prognosis as she has had papillary thyroid cancer which is less than 4cm in size without lymph node or other organ involvement. The most appropriate way to monitor for cancer recurrence is annual thyroglobulin. Imaging is unlikely to detect a recurrence early and is therefore inappropriate. TSH and free T4 levels should be measured frequently as this patient will need thyroxine replacement, but this is not to detect recurrence of malignancy.

## Question #201

A frail 82-year-old gentleman was brought in by his daughter, who found him on the floor in his flat. He had tripped in a mechanical and had been unable to get back up, lying on the floor for the past 3 days. On examination, he appears extremely dehydrated but has no specific focal weakness, systemic examination is unremarkable. He has sustained no musculoskeletal injuries. His blood tests are as follows:

Na +

168 mmol/l

| K +               | 6.0 mmol/l                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Urea              | 24 mmol/l                                  |
| Creatinine        | 260 µmol/l (baseline 107 three months ago) |
| Creatinine kinase | 11,000 mmol/l                              |

ECG shows normal sinus rhythm at 99/ minute.

You diagnose him with rhabdomyolysis and an acute kidney injury, likely of a prerenal cause. Intravenous fluid rehydration is initiated with intravenous 5% dextrose. You ask your colleague to check the patient's blood tests in 12 hours.

What is the aim of correcting the patient's hypernatraemia?

- a) Reduce blood sodium to under 145 mmol/l as quickly as possible
- b) Reduce blood sodium by 0.5mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 6 mmol/l
- c) Reduce blood sodium by 1mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 12 mmol/l
- d) Aim for blood sodium above 145 mmol/l
- e) Blood sodium does not require monitoring if intravenous fluids is running, CK falling and renal function improving

Correct answer is b.

The correct answer is to reduce blood sodium by 0.5mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 6 mmol/l . In cases of hypernatraemia, it is important to correct the patient's sodium levels gradually to avoid complications such as cerebral oedema and central pontine myelinolysis. Aiming for a reduction rate of 0.5mmol/hr ensures that the correction is slow and controlled, allowing the body to adapt safely.

The first option, reduce blood sodium to under 145 mmol/l as quickly as possible , is incorrect because rapidly correcting hypernatraemia can lead to severe neurological complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis). It is crucial to correct sodium levels slowly and cautiously.

The second incorrect option, reduce blood sodium by 1mmol/hr. The drop in 12 hours should be no greater than 12 mmol/l , suggests a faster rate of correction than recommended. This approach also increases the risk of complications, particularly in elderly patients who may have reduced physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to rapid changes in serum electrolyte concentrations.

The fourth option, aim for blood sodium above 145 mmol/l , contradicts the goal of treating hypernatraemia. A normal serum sodium level ranges from approximately 135-145 mmol/l; thus, maintaining a level above this range would not address the patient's underlying issue.

Finally, the last option, blood sodium does not require monitoring if intravenous fluids are running, CK falling and renal function improving , is incorrect because regular monitoring of blood sodium levels during treatment for rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury is essential. Monitoring allows clinicians to assess response to therapy, adjust fluid management as needed, and detect potential complications early.

## Question #202

A 19-year-old with type 1 diabetes presents to the Emergency Department feeling unwell. She states she has had vomiting and diarrhoea for 2 days and has not been taking her full insulin doses as she has been off her food. Her capillary glucose is 37 mmol/l and there are 4+ ketones on urinalysis.

An arterial blood gas is performed and the results are as follows:

pH

| pO2   | 13 kPa     |
|-------|------------|
| pCO2  | 3.5 kPa    |
| HCO 3 | 13         |
| Na    | 129 mmol/l |
| K     | 6.1 mmol/l |

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?

- a) IV 0.9% NaCl bolus
- b) IV 10 units actrapid + 50ml 50% dextrose
- c) IV 8.4% sodium bicarbonate
- d) Empirical IV antibiotics
- e) Insulin sliding scale

## Correct naawer is a.

This is a classical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis. While precise protocols vary, the key principals are initial fluid resuscitation with normal saline prior to starting an IV insulin infusion, and careful potassium replacement.

Low sodium is often seen and is a pseudohyponatraemia secondary to the high serum glucose.

Serum potassium derangements are common and need careful management. Potassium is driven into cells by insulin. Serum potassium levels are therefore often high on presentation while blood insulin levels are depleted. Despite this, total body potassium is low due to fluid losses and requires careful monitoring and replacement during treatment.

## Question #203

A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with headaches. These have been happening intermittently for the last 3 months but this one is particularly painful. They are associated with sweating and palpitations. She has found that headaches are often triggered after drinking coffee.

Neurological examination is normal. Observations are heart rate 119/min, blood pressure 186/108mmHg, respiratory rate 18/min, oxygen saturation 99%, temperature 37.3ºC.

What is the most appropriate management?

- a) Glyceryl trinitrate intravenous infusion
- b) Labetalol intravenous bolus injection
- c) Labetalol intravenous infusion
- d) Phenoxybenzamine intravenous infusion
- e) Phenoxybenzamine orally

Correct answer  is e.

PH aeochromocytoma - give PH enoxybenzamine before beta-blockers

The combination of headache, tachycardia, and diaphoresis alongside significant hypertension is suggestive of phaeochromocytoma. This is additionally supported by the intermittent nature of the symptoms. There are several recognised triggers for 'attacks', including dietary factors such as cheese, tomatoes, and coffee.

Both alpha-blockers and beta-blockers are used in the management of phaeochromocytoma. Alpha-blockers oppose catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. An alpha-blockade must be performed first with the alphablocker phenoxybenzamine. This medication only has oral forms available and licenced in the BNF and therefore phenoxybenzamine orally is the correct answer. If the beta-receptors are blocked first this leads to a loss of beta-mediated vasodilation and the subsequent unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can precipitate extreme hypertension.

A glyceryl trinitrate intravenous infusion can be used for treating significant hypertension. In phaeochromocytoma, hypertension is primarily driven by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system through the release of catecholamines acting on alpha receptors. Therefore, the most appropriate and effective way to counter this is through an alpha-blocker.

Labetalol is a beta-blocker. Although beta-blockers play a role in the management of phaeochromocytoma, it is important to give alpha-blockers first as mentioned above. Therefore, both labetalol intravenous bolus injection and labetalol intravenous infusion are incorrect.

Phenoxybenzamine intravenous infusion is incorrect, only oral forms of this medication are available and licenced in the BNF.

## Question #204

A 57-year-old female presents after noticing a lump in her neck. She reports it being non-tender and she is only concerned about it for cosmetic purposes. She reports no other symptoms. Her past medical history includes hypertension and constipation. Her current medications include ramipril, irbesartan, amlodipine and furosemide. No family history is unavailable. On examination, her neck lump is hard, non-tender and measures 2cm by 1 cm, moves with swallowing but not with tongue protrusion. Her heart rate is 84 beats/min and blood pressure 213/130 mmHg. Examination of her joints was unremarkable with no excessive laxity.

Her blood tests are as follows:

Hb

112 g/l

| Platelets        | 349 * 10 9 /l   |
|------------------|-----------------|
| WBC              | 7.2 * 10 9 /l   |
| Na +             | 138mmol/l       |
| K +              | 4.2 mmol/l      |
| Urea             | 6.9 mmol/l      |
| Creatinine       | 72 µmol/l       |
| Adjusted calcium | 3.1 mmol/l      |
| Phosphate        | 0.40 mmol/l     |

She undergoes an outpatient ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of her neck lump. After her procedure, the recovery nurses were concerned regarding her persistent hypertension and the patient is admitted for further investigation. She develops a mild headache with no visual disturbances, resolving on its own after her blood pressure falls to 182/101 mmHg two hours later. Urinary metanephrine collection was positive.

Which investigation is likely to produce the underlying diagnosis?

- a) Genetic testing for RET mutation
- b) Genetic testing for germline VHL mutation
- c) Genetic testing for NF2 mutation on chromosome 22
- d) CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast
- e) Urinary calcium collection

Correct answer is a.

The clinical collection of phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism should raise suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a, which is a genetic syndrome of near 100% penetrance caused by a mutation of the RET oncogene. The addition of a thyroid lump makes this scenario more suggestive of MEN 2, with medullary thyroid carcinoma completing the diagnosis. MEN2b is subtly differentiated from MEN2a by the lack of hyperparathyroidism and Marfanoid features. Unlikely MEN 1, genetic screening of family members for hyperparathyroidism and germline mutation is useful for long-term surveillance and monitoring. VHL and NF 2 mutations refer to von-Hippel Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 2 respectively: VHL presents classically as a combination of retinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas and phaeochromocytomas while NF2 typically present with intracranial tumours, bilateral Schwannomas almost in all patients.

## Question #205

A 47-year-old female presents with recurrent palpitations. She also complains of associated sweating, blurring of vision and generalized weakness. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath or loss of consciousness. She had several similar episodes over last few months. The episodes usually occur in the morning or just before a meal. She has noticed that her symptoms improve after she eats something. She has gained weight of about 9 kg over last few months. She has a past history of an anxiety disorder but is not currently taking any regular medications. She does not smoke and only occasionally drinks alcohol. Her blood glucose at present is 4.9 mmol. You suspect insulinoma based on the history.

What is the next step in the evaluation of this patient?

- a) Check insulin level
- b) Check pro-insulin level
- c) CT abdomen
- d) Screening for sulphonylurea drugs
- e) Check blood glucose during or after the episode to confirm hypoglycemia Correct answer is e.

Completion of Whipple's triad is required before further investigations for insulinoma

European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) guidelines published in 2016 outline the diagnostic criteria for insulinomas. As symptoms of hypoglycemia can be non-specific and attributable to several different conditions, it is important to confirm hypoglycemia by checking blood glucose. Therefore, completion of Whipple's triad is required before embarking on further investigations. Whipple's triad is defined as the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms, accompanying low blood glucose, and resolution of symptoms after correcting the blood glucose levels.

Therefore, the best answer here is 5 i.e confirming the hypoglycemia will be the next step in the evaluation of this patient.

All the other options are relevant to the diagnosis but not the best next step here.

## Question #206

A 19-year-old girl was seen in clinic with lethargy, weakness worsening over the past 4 weeks. She also complains of recurrent muscle cramps in her legs, causing her to have trouble sleeping. On further questioning she admits to urinary frequency, passing urine up to ten times a day, and feels dehydrated all the time. She also mentions that her periods which were usually irregular, have stopped 4 months ago.

On examination, she is thin, with a body mass index of 17kg/m². Her heart rate is 88 bpm and blood pressure is 108/86 mmHg.

What would be the next most useful investigation?

- a) Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) of the ovaries
- b) Urine diuretic assay
- c) Early morning cortisol
- d) Serum renin and aldosterone levels
- e) Fasting blood glucose levels

Correct answer is b.

Patients with hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis and a normal - low blood pressure the following differentials should be considered - diuretic abuse, Bartter's syndrome, Gitelman's syndrome. Of the three, the most common cause is diuretic abuse, especially in young women, and can be ruled out with a urine diuretic assay.

Bartter's syndrome presents early in life, with classical features of triangular facies, polyuria, polydipsia and renal failure. Serum renin and aldosterone levels are high despite a low or normal blood pressure. Urine calcium may be raised, and renal stones are a common feature. In Gitelman's syndrome patients may present later on in adulthood, but have a milder disease course or may be asymptomatic compared to patients with Bartter's syndrome. Hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria differentiates Gitelman's syndrome from Bartter's syndrome.

This patient may need other further investigations such as a TVUS, early morning cortisol and fasting blood glucose tests to rule out other conditions, but in view of her biochemistry profile, a urine diuretic assay would be the most useful next investigation to perform.

## Question #207

A 42-year-old woman was seen in clinic with a history of palpitation, tremor and weight loss. There is no other past medical history and she takes no regular medication.

On examination, she had a palpable goitre, exophthalmos, and a tremor of the out-stretched hands.

Thyroid function tests showed:

| Free thyroxine (T4)         | 36 pmol/L (10-25)   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Free triiodothyronine (T3)  | 15 pmol/L (5-10)    |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone | 0.1mU/L (0.4-5.0)   |

Which of the following treatments should be prescribed initially to improve symptoms?

- a) Thyroidectomy
- b) Propanolol
- c) Radioiodine ablation
- d) Carbimazole
- e) Propylthiouracil

Correct answer is b.

Propranolol should be used in new cases of Graves' disease to help control symptoms

There is a high suspicion of Grave's disease in this patient, and further investigation with a thyroid autoantibody profile is warranted.

Beta blockers are used to treat the symptoms of increased beta-adrenergic tone that are seen in Grave's disease. Other such symptoms include anxiety and heat intolerance.

Thioamides are used to treat Grave's hyperthyroidism, but not specifically the symptoms of increased beta-adrenergic tone. While the anti-thyroid effect of these drugs has a rapid onset, their clinical effect is more delayed because the pre-formed store of hormone in the thyroid gland and bound to thyroid-binding globulin must first be exhausted.

## Question #208

A 40-year-old woman attends the endocrinology clinic with a 4-week history of intermittent headaches and milky discharge from her nipples. Over the last 5 months, she also reports absent menstrual periods despite usually having a regular 28-day cycle. There is no past medical history of note and she has no allergies.

## Laboratory tests:

| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 0.5 mU/L   | (0.5-5.5)     |
|-------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 7.5 pmol/L | (9.0 - 18)    |
| Adrenocorticotrophic hormone        | 6 ng/L     | (0 - 47)      |
| IGF-1                               | 10 nmol/L  | (12.4 - 30.3) |
| Prolactin                           | 6000 IU/mL | (59 - 619)    |

MRI head: there is a visible pituitary adenoma of approximately 1.5cm in size causing compression of the optic chiasm.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

- a) Bromocriptine
- b) Dexamethasone
- c) Domperidone
- d) Stereotactic radiotherapy
- e) Trans-sphenoidal surgery

Correct answer is a.

Dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline, bromocriptine) are first-line treatment for prolactinomas, even if there are significant neurological complications

Given the history of amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea and the blood results demonstrating an elevated prolactin level with low-normal thyroid, IGF-1 and

ACTH levels, this patient has a diagnosis of prolactinoma. This is confirmed by the presence of a pituitary mass of 1.5cm in size that classifies this growth as a macroadenoma. The first-line treatment for all prolactinomas (regardless of size) is the use of dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Dopamine suppresses the production of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland and thus helps improve this patient's symptoms.

Dexamethasone is commonly indicated in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or space-occupying lesions. Although this patient has a significant pituitary adenoma, evidence of compression of the optic chiasm and neurological symptoms including headaches, dexamethasone is not first-line in the treatment of prolactinomas. Rather, dopamine agonists are preferred.

Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist and would be contraindicated in this patient given that dopamine suppresses prolactin production and further inhibition could drive the growth of the prolactinoma.

Stereotactic radiotherapy is less popular in the treatment of such small lesions, given the risk of damage to adjacent structures and would therefore not be a firstline treatment for this patient.

Trans-sphenoidal surgery is an alternative treatment option for prolactinomas. However, this is reserved if medical treatment with dopamine agonists fails. As dopamine agonists have not yet been initiated for this patient, bromocriptine would be the correct answer.

## Question #209

A 24-year-old lady presents to hospital with increasing confusion. Her parents describe a gradual history of weight loss, lethargy with abdominal cramping. She has no past medical history and is prescribed no regular medications. She lives with her parents. Her mother suffers from hypothyroidism and her father from hypertension which is controlled with bendroflumethiazide.

On examination she is thin, with cool skin and sunken eyes. Her capillary refill time is 3 seconds with dry mucous membranes. Auscultation of her chest reveals bilateral symmetrical vesicular breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. She is confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14. She has no focal neurology.

Her investigations reveal;

| Hb         | 10.4 g/dL   |
|------------|-------------|
| MCV        | 90 fL       |
| WCC        | 6.4 *10^9/l |
| Platelet s | 170 *10^9/l |

| Na+     | 105 mmol/L   |
|---------|--------------|
| K+      | 5.8 mmol/L   |
| Ur      | 8.8 mmol/L   |
| Cr      | 90 µmol/L    |
| Glucose | 3.9 mmol/L   |

Urinary Osmolality

108 mmol/L

| Chest X ray   | Clear                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| CT Head       | No intracranial abnormalities |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Adrenal insufficiency
- b) Laxative abuse
- c) Hypothyroidism
- d) Diuretic use
- e) SiADH

Corectr answer is a.

This lady has hypovolaemic hyponatraemia. Sodium can be lost through the gastrointestinal tract, skin or urinary tract. This patient is likely to have renal loss secondary to adrenal insufficiency.

The urinary sodium would be reduced if there were gastrointestinal or skin losses. Also, the patient would be hypokalaemic if there were laxative abuse. The patient would be expected to have hypokalaemia if there were abuse of bendrofumethiazide.

The patient is hypovolaemic and therefore SiADH is excluded, also, hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency have not been excluded which would be necessary to make the diagnosis of SiADH.

Hypothyroidism classically presents with weight gain and euvolaemic hyponatraemia.

This patient has adrenal insufficiency. It is possibly of an autoimmune nature with a probable autoimmune hypothyroidism in the immediate family. She has a gradual onset of non-specific symptoms lethargy, weight loss and abdominal symptoms. The hyponatraemia has caused confusion. The blood tests reveal hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia with hyperkalaemia and normocytic anaemia. Examination revealed signs of hypovolaemia, it also could show skin or mucus membrane pigmentation.

## Question #210

You are asked to review a 62 year-old Caucasian man who is an inpatient on the medical admissions unit. He is currently being treated for a left lower lobe community acquired pneumonia. You note consumed alcohol excessively prior to admission but has been abstinent for the last four days.

During this admission it has been noted that serial bloods glucose measurements have been elevated and subsequently a new diagnosis type two diabetes has been made. The admission consultant noted Cushingoid featured and requested an overnight low dose dexamethasone suppression test. The results are as follows:

| 8am Cortisol after 1mg dexamethasone at 11pm the previous day   | 438 nmol/L     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Reference range for serum cortisol                              | 170-540 nmol/L |

What is most appropriate next step in the investigation of this gentleman?

- a) Serum ACTH measurement
- b) Midnight serum cortisol
- c) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling post CRH administration
- d) High dose dexamethasone suppression test

## e) MRI pituitary

Correct answer is b.

Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome is common in those with excessive alcohol consumption. The physical signs resemble true Cushing's syndrome however the aetiology is idiopathic rather than dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It is therefore important to exclude pseudo-Cushing's prior to further investigation.

The hallmark of true Cushing's syndrome is lack of diurnal variation in serum cortisol. However in pseudo-Cushing's diurnal variation is normally maintained. Those with pseudo-Cushing's will have elevated 24 hour urinary cortisol and will also fail to suppress serum cortisol with a low dose dexamethasone suppression test. The correct approach in this case is therefore to measure a midnight cortisol prior to proceeding to further investigation.

## Question #211

A 27-year-old female presents with secondary amenorrhoea after stopping the oral contraceptive pill 6 months ago. She gets regular headaches and struggles to stand from seated or climb stairs.

On examination, milk could be expressed from the breasts and visual fields showed bilateral defects in the upper outer quadrants.

| Prolactin   | 1080 mIU/L (NR<360)   |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| FSH         | 0.1 IU/L (NR 1-11)    |
| LH          | 0.2 IU/L (NR 20-75)   |

| TSH          | 0.1 mIU/L (NR 0.3-6.0)   |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| T4           | 8 pmol/L (NR 10-25)      |
| 9am cortisol | 20 nmol/L (NR 140-700)   |

Pituitary MRI: 3cm pituitary mass with tenting of optic chiasm.

What is the next step in management?

- a) Bromocriptine
- b) Octreotide
- c) Stereotactic radiotherapy
- d) Trans-sphenoidal surgery
- e) Transcranial hypophysectomy

## Correct answer is d.

This patient has a macroadenoma (&gt;1cm) causing visual field defects. Transsphenoidal surgery is the first step in management. Raised prolactin can be secondary to blockage of the pituitary stalk with prevention of dopamine reaching the pituitary causing disinhibition of the lactotrophs.

Prolactin secreting macroadenomas secrete very high quantities and PRL is usually &gt;6000mU/ml particularly with macro-prolactinomas (this is not the case making a prolactinoma unlikely). Prolactinomas are treated with dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) first-line. Octreotide is used to treat acromegaly.

Transcranial hypophysectomy is done for very large tumours that cant be removed via the trans-sphenoidal route.

A 34-year-old patient is brought by ambulance to the emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and emotionally unstable personality disorder. She takes metformin and gliclazide. She smokes ten cigarettes daily. She is unemployed.

Her observations are heart rate 111 beats per minute, blood pressure 101/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 21/minute, oxygen saturations 96% on room air and temperature 37ºC.

On examination, her Glasgow coma scale is 9/15 (E1 V3 M5). The cardiorespiratory examination is normal. Abdominal examination is normal. Neurological examination reveals normal tone, downgoing plantars. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.

A bedside blood glucose level is 1.8 mmol/L.

Despite 2 x 100ml boluses of 10% dextrose and a subsequent dextrose infusion, the patient experiences recurrent hypoglycaemia.

What is the next most appropriate pharmacological treatment?

- a) Activated charcoal
- b) Enteral supplementation
- c) Octreotide
- d) 10% dextrose
- e) 50% dextrose

Correct answer is c.

In sulphonylurea overdoses, if the patient remains hypoglycaemic despite infusion of sufficient glucose, consider administration of octeotride

Octreotide is correct. This patient has recurrent hypoglycaemia in the context of known sulphonylurea use an emotionally unstable personality disorder. It is likely that she has taken a sulphonylurea overdose. Despite dextrose supplementation, she experiences recurrent hypoglycaemia. Octreotide blocks insulin secretion. The rationale being that dextrose precipitates further insulin release, causing a vicious cycle of insulin secretion. Octreotide prevents further insulin release in sulphonylurea overdose and is an option if the patient remains hypoglycaemic.

Activated charcoal is incorrect. This typically needs to be given within 1-2 hours of administration of sulphonylureas and we do not know the time of ingestion.

10% dextrose is incorrect. Despite sufficient dextrose administration, the patient remains hypoglycaemic and therefore an alternative treatment is needed.

Enteral supplementation is incorrect. The patient has a GCS of 9/15 and therefore enteral supplementation would be inappropriate.

50% dextrose is incorrect. The patient has already had a typically sufficient administration of dextrose. The patient remains hypoglycaemic, likely because of ongoing endogenous secretion of insulin in response to the glucose load and needs alternative treatment that blocks insulin secretion.

## Question #213

A 17-year-old woman presents to the clinic with amenorrhea. She advises you that she has never had a menstrual cycle. On examination, you note little axillary and pubic hair. There are also bilateral groin swellings. Her vagina and labia have a normal appearance.

Blood results are as follows:

| Testosteron e   | 11.2 nmol/L   | (< 1.8)      |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| FSH             | 16 IU/L       | (1.8 - 22.5) |
| LH              | 120 IU/L      | (1.2-103)    |

## What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS)
- b) Kallmann's syndrome
- c) Mullerian agenesis
- d) Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS)
- e) Turner's syndrome

Correct answer is a.

Primary amenorrhoea, little or no axillary and pubic hair, elevated testosterone → androgen insensitivity syndrome

Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is correct. The clinical features of primary amenorrhea, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, and groin swellings (suggestive of undescended testes) are suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. The hormonal profile findings of very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH are classical findings of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. The presence of a normal vagina and labia favour complete rather than partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.

Kallmann's syndrome is incorrect. Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Cryptorchidism can also occur. However, the biochemical profile, in this case, is not in keeping with Kallmann's syndrome - which would present with low sex hormone levels, and inappropriately low/normal LH, and FSH levels.

Mullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Both Mullerian agenesis and androgen insensitivity syndrome can present with primary amenorrhea, shortened vagina, and absent cervix. However, in patients with androgen insensitivity, the gonads are testes, which produce normal androgens. The presence of bilateral groin swellings (indicative of undescended testes) makes Mullerian agenesis a less likely diagnosis.

Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is incorrect. The clinical and biochemical features are suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. However the presence of a normal vagina and labia favour complete rather than partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. PAIS results in a spectrum of disorders that ranges from a female phenotype with clitoromegaly and/or minimal posterior labial fusion (Lub syndrome) to genital ambiguity to an unequivocally male phenotype with a minor defect such as isolated hypospadias or azoospermia.

Turner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. However, the biochemical profile, in this case, is not in keeping with Turner's syndrome - which would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels.

## Question #214

A 28-year-old woman presents with flu-like symptoms, palpitations and pain over the anterior neck over the past 2-3 weeks. She has also suffered rapid weight loss and feels increasingly anxious that there may be something seriously wrong with her. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone has been measured at &lt;0.05 IU by her GP. On examination her blood pressure is 128/82 mmHg, her pulse is 95 beats per minute and regular, and she has a fine tremor. There is mild tenderness over the anterior neck. Body mass index is 22 kg/m²

Which of the following would you also expect to find?

- a) Erythema nodosum
- b) Exophthalmos
- c) Multiple small thyroid nodules on ultrasound scan
- d) Positive anti-thyroid antibodies
- e) Reduced uptake on thyroid scintigraphy

Correct answer is e.

In De Quervain's thyroiditis there is globally reduced uptake of iodine-131 during thyroid scintigraphy

The most likely diagnosis, given the history of 2-3 weeks of flu-like symptoms and suppressed TSH, is subacute thyroiditis where thyroid inflammation drives increased release of stored thyroid hormone, rather than the clinical picture being due to overproduction of T3 and T4. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism should be managed with beta blockade as required, and there is no role for thioamides. Pain over the thyroid can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After a period of hyperthyroidism, rebound hypothyroidism may be seen, followed by a recovery to euthyroidism.

Erythema nodosum is not associated with subacute thyroiditis. Exophthalmos and positive anti-thyroid antibodies are associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. Multiple small thyroid nodules are a feature of multinodular goitre.

## Question #215

A 28-year-old woman attends your pre-natal endocrinology clinic. She has been taking 100 micrograms of levothyroxine daily due to hypothyroidism and is currently 6 weeks pregnant, there have been no recent changes to her dosage.

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 5.0 mU/L    | (0.5-5.5)   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 10.0 pmol/L | (9.0 - 18)  |

What would you recommend regarding her levothyroxine dose?

- a) Continue on current levothyroxine dose, no further monitoring required during pregnancy
- b) Increase levothyroxine dose to 150 micrograms daily
- c) Increase levothyroxine dose to 200 micrograms once daily immediately
- d) Reduce levothyroxine dose to 75 micrograms once daily
- e) Repeat thyroid function tests at 12 weeks gestation and then consider adjusting levothyroxine dose

Correct answer is b.

Women with hypothyroidism may need to increase their thyroid hormone replacement dose by up to 50% as early as 4-6 weeks of pregnancy

During pregnancy, the thyroid gland increases in size by 10% and the production of thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, increases by 50%.

If a patient has pre-existing hypothyroidism, we usually need to increase the dose of levothyroxine to mimic these changes.

Increase levothyroxine dose to 150 micrograms daily : an increase of levothyroxine supplementation of up to 50% mimics the physiological thyroid response to pregnancy and is the correct option for this patient.

Continue on current levothyroxine dose, no further monitoring required during pregnancy : this is incorrect. The requirement for T3 and T4 increases during pregnancy, therefore the levothyroxine dose must be increased.

Increase levothyroxine dose to 200 micrograms once daily immediately : this increase is too high, the patient does not require such an aggressive dosage adjustment.

Reduce levothyroxine dose to 75 micrograms once daily : incorrect, levothyroxine dose should not routinely be reduced during pregnancy, the requirement generally increases.

Repeat thyroid function tests at 12 weeks gestation and then consider adjusting levothyroxine dose : this would be inappropriate, thyroid abnormalities should be treated as soon as possible to minimise the risk to the foetus. Ideally, the patient should be counselled before conception. Maternal hypothyroidism is associated with low birth weight, premature labour, and neonatal respiratory problems.

## Question #216

A 39-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient department by her GP having been unsuccessfully treated with trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for recurrent urinary tract infections. These have been occurring over the past six months. Over the last 2 days, the patient reports that urinating has become very painful and that the patient is now having difficulty urinating. The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. After completing a course of amoxicillin, the patient still complains of pain on urinating and pain in the lower abdomen. There is a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the patient has a smoking history of 5 pack years, while drinking on average 15 units per week. An HbA1c test is performed and reveals a result of 82 mmol/mol.

What is the most likely organism causing the recurrent urinary tract infections?

- a) Candida
- b) Neisseria gonorrhoea
- c) Chlamydia trachomatis
- d) Trichomonas vaginalis
- e) Mycoplasma genitalium

Correct answer is a.

The most likely organism in this scenario is candida - in those individuals who do have symptomatic Candida infections, the symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by bacterial infections. Cystitis is associated with dysuria, urgency, suprapubic discomfort. This patients recent symptoms of oliguria, difficultly passing urine and painful urination suggest a complication such as the presence of a fungus ball.

## Question #217

A 45-year-old gentleman presents to clinic for review. Two weeks ago he presented to the emergency department with renal colic. A spiral CT KUB confirmed nephrolithiasis and he was managed conservatively with IV fluids, analgesia and an alpha-blocker. His symptoms resolved entirely and he was discharged.

## Blood tests:

| Hb                  | 142 g/l                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Platelets           | 329 * 10 9 /l                |
| WBC                 | 6.6 * 10 9 /l                |
| Na +                | 141 mmol/l                   |
| K +                 | 3.8 mmol/l                   |
| Urea                | 6.2 mmol/l                   |
| Creatinine          | 71 µmol/l                    |
| Corrected calcium   | 2.71 mmol/l                  |
| Parathyroid hormone | 10.2 pmol/l (1.0-7.0 pmol/l) |

How should he be further managed?

- a) Annual monitoring of calcium and renal function
- b) Encourage oral fluids
- c) Bisphosphonates
- d) Vitamin D supplementation
- e) Parathyroidectomy

## Correct answer is e.

The correct answer is parathyroidectomy. This is a patient who has developed renal colic secondary to likely primary hyperparathyroidism, as is suggested by his hypercalcaemia and elevated parathyroid hormone. The mainstay of management of primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy, but cases have to be appropriately identified as surgical candidates. This patient developed renal stones as a likely complication and therefore would benefit from surgery. If the blood tests been an incidental finding, then monitoring and oral fluids both would have been more appropriate.

## Question #218

A 43-year-old man presents to his general practitioner complaining of generalized aches and pains. He has a past medical history of glaucoma and takes acetazolamide. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. He is a marketing manager for a large international fashion brand.

On examination, he has subtle proximal myopathy. There is no synovitis.

## Blood tests:

| Hb          | 136 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets   | 189 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC         | 8.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |
| Na +        | 137 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |
| K +         | 2.8 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |
| Urea        | 5.2 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)                           |
| Creatinine  | 89 µmol/L     | (55 - 120)                            |
| Bicarbonate | 16 mmol/L     | (22-29)                               |
| CRP         | 4 mg/L        | (< 5)                                 |

| Bilirubin           | 14 µmol/L   | (3 - 17)    |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| ALP                 | 165 u/L     | (30 - 100)  |
| ALT                 | 23 u/L      | (3 - 40)    |
| Î³GT                | 44 u/L      | (8 - 60)    |
| Albumin             | 36 g/L      | (35 - 50)   |
| Parathyroid hormone | 7.9 pmol/L  | (1.6-6.9)   |
| Calcium             | 2.08 mmol/L | (2.20-2.60) |
| Vitamin D           | 31nmol/L    | (>50)       |

What is the unifying diagnosis that explains the presentation?

- a) Osteoporosis
- b) Primary hyperparathyroidism
- c) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- e) Type 4 renal tubular acidosi

Correct answer is d.

Hypokalaemia, osteomalacia - type 2 renal tubular acidosis

Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is the correct answer. Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is characterized by the failure of proximal tubular cells to reabsorb bicarbonate, resulting in academia. It is associated with hypokalemia and the development of osteomalacia. The traditional explanation for osteomalacia in this setting is that the proximal tubular conversion of 25 (OH)-cholecalciferol to the active 1,25 (OH)2-cholecalciferol is impaired. Acetazolamide treatment is a known cause of type 2 renal tubular acidosis. This patient presents with aches and pains and proximal myopathy, low vitamin D, low calcium and raised PTH, typical of osteomalacia. Additionally, there is academia (low serum bicarbonate) and hypokalemia. The unifying diagnosis is type 2 renal tubular acidosis secondary to acetazolamide treatment.

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is usually associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia.

Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is less likely to cause osteomalacia and not associated with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use. It is associated with the development of nephrocalcinosis.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect. This patient has an appropriately raised parathyroid hormone as a consequence of vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia.

Osteoporosis is incorrect. Calcium is typically normal in this condition and it is characterized by fracture and low T scores, rather than proximal myopathy and generalized aches and pains.

## Question #219

You are seeing a 58-year-old man in clinic who has been referred by his GP with resistant hypertension despite treatment with ramipril, amlodipine, indapamide and bisoprolol. He looks comfortable at rest.

Observations are as follows: temperature 36.5ºC, blood pressure 182/125 mmHg, heart rate 88/min, respiratory rate 16/min, saturations 97% on air

Investigations are as follows:

Na +

148 mmol/l

K +

2.9 mmol/l

Urea

6.5 mmol/l

Creatinin

e

92 µmol/l

| Renin                            | Low                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Aldosterone (supine)             | High                        |
| Aldosterone (prolonged standing) | Increase from supine levels |

## Blood gases:

| PaO2   | 11.2kPa   |
|--------|-----------|
| PaCO2  | 5.2kPa    |
| pH     | 7.49      |
| HC03-  | 32 mmol/l |
| BE     | +4        |

What is the single most likely diagnosis?

- a) Adrenal hyperplasia
- b) Conn's adenoma
- c) Malignant hypertension
- d) Phaeochromocytoma
- e) Renal artery stenosis

Correct answer is a.

All of the above diagnoses could cause hypertension. This patient has a hypokalaemic alkalosis and low renin. The differentials are therefore Conn's adenoma and adrenal hyperplasia. To differentiate between the two look at the aldosterone on standing. In this case, the aldosterone increases on prolonged standing, therefore, the diagnosis is adrenal hyperplasia. In Conn's adenoma, the aldosterone would stay the same or drop on standing.

In malignant hypertension and renal artery stenosis, the renin would be high.

## Question #220

A 21-year-old female presents with a vague two month history of lethargy, muscle pain and weight loss. Examination is unremarkable. Observations included heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 14/min, oxygen saturations are 99% on air, blood pressure of 110/80mmHg. She was apyrexial.

Routine bloods are sent.

| Hb         | 150 g/l        | Na +       | 128 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 200 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 2.9 mmol/l   |
| WBC        | 12.0 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 7.0 mmol/l   |
| Neuts      | 8.0 * 10 9 /l  | Creatinine | 85 µmol/l    |
| Lymphs     | 4.0 * 10 9 /l  | CRP        | 11 mg/l      |

What is the next most appropriate investigation?

- a) Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax
- b) ltrasound of the renal tract
- c) Serum aldosterone
- d) Urinary electrolytes
- e) Short synacthen test

Correct answer is d.

The combination of lethargy, weight loss, low sodium and low potassium in a young patient suggest an inherited renal pathology such as Bartter's or Gitelman's syndrome. Liddle's syndrome is usually associated with high blood pressure.

Urinary electrolytes are a quick and simple test and would be likely to aid the diagnosis here.

Most other causes alluded to here would not cause both sodium and potassium to be low.

## Question #221

A 28-year-old woman is referred to the hospital with dysphagia. She complains of fatigue and that she often struggles to swallow certain foods such as bread. Drinking has not been a problem.

In addition, her eyes often feel gritty and uncomfortable. She has mild myalgia which interferes with her job at the local bakery.

What other finding would be consistent with the most likely diagnosis?

- a) C-ANCA positive
- b) P-ANCA positive
- c) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- e) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis

Correct answer is c.

Type 1 ( distal ) renal tubular acidosis may be caused by Sjogren's syndrome

This patient has features consistent with Sjogren's syndrome. The xerostomia (dry mouth) can lead to difficulty swallowing, particularly foods needing more saliva. The other characteristic feature is xerophthalmia (dry eyes) which can make the eyes feel gritty and uncomfortable. Sjogren's syndrome is associated with type 1 renal tubular acidosis .

Type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis occurs due to an inability to excrete H+ in the distal tubule. The resulting acidosis is usually accompanied by hypokalaemia. Complications include nephrocalcinosis and renal stones. Causes include idiopathic, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjogren's, amphotericin B toxicity, and analgesic nephropathy.

A sometimes helpful reminder is that type 1 renal tubular acidosis is largely associated with structural/rheumatological problems, whereas, type 2 renal tubular acidosis is associated with metabolic disorders such as Fanconi syndrome, Wilson's disease, and cystinosis.

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypoaldosteronism and diabetes, rather than Sjogren's. Type 4 is associated with hyperkalaemia, whilst types 1 and 2 are associated with hypokalaemia.

Sjogren's is typically associated with elevated levels of anti-Ro and anti-La. Neither cANCA nor pANCA are typically associated. ANCA antibodies are commonly associated with vasculitides. cANCA (cytoplasmic-ANCA) is associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. pANCA is found in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

## Question #222

A 28-year-old woman is referred by her GP with refractory hypertension. Despite combination therapy with ramipril, amlodipine, bendroflumethiazide and atenolol, her blood pressure in clinic today is 181/105 mmHg. Some of her bloods are shown below. On direct questioning she also admits passing urine more than 10 times per day. What is the most likely diagnosis?

| Na +        | 145 mmol/l   |
|-------------|--------------|
| K +         | 3.0 mmol/l   |
| Urea        | 6.0 mmol/l   |
| Creatinin e | 71 µmol/l    |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Phaeochromocytoma
- b) Coarctation of the aorta
- c) Renal artery stenosis
- d) 21-hydroxylase deficiency
- e) Conn's syndrome

Correct answer is e.

All of the answers above are causes of secondary hypertension, except for 21hydroxylase deficiency which accounts for over 90% of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

The high sodium and low potassium in the bloods reflects the increased levels of aldosterone produced in Conn's syndrome. Aldosterone stimulates the Na+/K+ATPase membrane transporter in the distal convoluted tubule resulting in increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Polyuria and polydipsia can result from the kidneys inability to concentrate urine.

The diagnosis is usually confirmed using plasma aldosterone:renin ratio

## Question #223

A 29-year-old woman presents to the ENT clinic with hoarseness. She has found herself to be hoarse for three weeks and despite drinking plenty of fluids finds herself unable to improve. She was referred to the ENT clinic after a phone consultation with her GP. On examination she has a goitre which is not painful. On further questioning she has no symptoms consistent with an overactive or underactive thyroid. She also feels well in herself. She has no problem speaking apart from the hoarseness, and is not struggling to catch her breath. What is the most appropriate course of action?

- a) Immediate hospital admission under endocrinology
- b) Two-week wait appointment with an endocrinologist
- c) Routine appointment with an endocrinologist
- d) Reassure and discharge back to GP
- e) Arrange for bronchoscopy

Correct answer is b.

Goitre with unexplained hoarseness should be referred urgently

The combination of thyroid swelling with hoarseness or change in voice which is unexplained needs urgent referral to endocrinology for likely thyroid cancer. Thyroid nodules in a child, thyroid mass with cervical lymphadenopathy or a rapidly enlarging and painless thyroid mass also need a two-week wait referral for suspect thyroid cancer. A patient with a thyroid mass and stridor may need immediate admission. Patients with a thyroid swelling and abnormal thyroid function tests, or sudden pain in a thyroid lump, can be referred non-urgently.

## Question #224

A 59-year-old man presents to the medical clinic. He has a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gout, obesity and cholecystectomy. He takes metformin and allopurinol. He has no allergies as far as he is aware. His total cholesterol is 4.8mmol/mol. He is concerned that his brother recently had a heart attack and was wondering if there is any medication that he should take to further reduce his risk of heart attacks. He smokes roughly five cigarettes per day, of which he has been trying to reduce. His blood pressure is 132/71mmHg. What is the most appropriate action?

- a) Start atorvastatin 20mg ON
- b) Start atorvastatin 80mg ON
- c) Start aspirin 75mg OD
- d) Start clopidogrel 75mg OD
- e) Start ezetimibe 10mg OD

Correct answer is a.

Patients with T2DM should not be routinely started on statins; their QRISK2 score should be calculated

This is a patient with high risk in terms of cardiovascular disease due to the fact that he is male, has obesity, is a current smoker and has a strong family history of heart disease. Therefore it is very important to manage his risk factors. In patients with type 2 diabetes, risk should be assessed using the QRISK2 method. This formula uses cardiovascular risk factors and estimates risk of cardiovascular ischaemia within the next 10 years. If you were to assess this patient, his risk would be far greater than 25%. NICE guidelines advises that if the risk is greater than 10% then Atorvastatin 20mg at night should be started, and increased if the cholesterol does not fall. Starting 80mg of Atorvastatin would be appropriate in secondary prevention, such as following a myocardial infarction. NICE does not advise starting aspirin or clopidogrel as primary prevention unless there is a high risk for an ischaemic event, as determined by QRISK scoring, and the patient is hypertensive or being treated for hypertension. This is because the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is thought to outweigh the benefit of reduction in cardiovascular events in such patients.

## Question #225

A 32-year-old patient with Addison's disease comes for review into the endocrinology clinic. He was diagnosed by Addison's disease nine months ago and has since then been started on 20mg of hydrocortisone taken in divided doses and 50micrograms of fludrocortisone. He complains of feeling intermittently tired but has otherwise is well. He has a history of hypothyroidism and takes 100 micrograms of levothyroxine for this. He has no other medical problems and feels well in his mood. His most recent TSH was done one month ago, and showed his thyroid function to be well within control. What investigation could be offered to assess if the dose of hydrocortisone represents accurate glucocorticoid replacement?

- a) Dexamethasone suppression test
- b) Cortisol day curve
- c) Synacthen test
- d) Morning serum cortisol
- e) Urinary electrolytes

Correct answer  is b.

A cortisol curve can be used to assess how appropriate dosing of glucocorticoid steroids in Addison's disease patients is

A cortisol day curve allows serial measurements to be taken to monitor how well cortisol is being replaced in patient with Addison's disease as well other causes of adrenal insufficiency such as panhypopituitarism. Morning serum cortisol is an appropriate investigation as first line testing for Addisons's disease, with Synacthen testing to confirm that diagnosis. Dexamethasone suppression testing can confirm Cushing's syndrome. Urinary electrolytes would be appropriate in the diagnosis of SIADH.

## Question #226

A 72-year-old female presents with 5 days of general decline following a recent urinary tract infection, treated with oral antibiotics in the community by the GP. She is known to be a type 2 diabetic, diagnosed 28 years ago and insulin dependent for the past 6 years. She is normally on 46 units Lantus, 23 units TDS Novorapid. On examination, she is not orientated in time or place, GCS 14/15. She has no focal neurology, chest and cardiovascular auscultation are unremarkable. You demonstrate suprapubic tenderness on deep palpation but the abdomen is other soft and non-tender, bowel sounds are present. She appears extremely dehydrated: her mucous membranes are dry, peripheries cool with capillary refill time of 4 seconds and JVP +1 cm above the angle of Louis. Her blood sugar is 31mmol/L and a venous blood gas demonstrates pH 7.22, lactate 2 mmol/l, ketones 5 mmol/l. A urine dip is awaited. What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Hyperglycaemic hyperketotic state
- b) Hyperglycaemia secondary to poor medical compliance during recent acute illness
- c) Urosepsis secondary to inadequately treated UTI
- d) Diabetic ketoacidosis
- e) Dehydration secondary to poor oral intake

## Correct answer is d.

The patient is acidotic with ketones &gt;3 mmol/l demonstrated, on a background of known insulin dependence. Although she is known to be a type 2 diabetic, it should be remembered that both types of diabetics can present as DKA, particularly advanced T2 DM who produce little to no endogenous insulin and are hence unable to shut down ketogenesis. Treatment should be as per DKA protocols, with intravenous fluids, fixed rate insulin infusion @ 0.1 unit/kg/hour, thromboprophylaxis, broad spectrum antibiotics and appropriate K+ replacement with insulin1.

## Question #227

A 72-year-old woman is recovering on the neurosurgical unit following a subdural haemorrhage. Four days earlier she underwent Burr hole surgery. You are asked to see her due to a persistently low sodium for the past three days. You note the following investigations:

## Day 2 post-surgery

Serum Na+

116 mmol/l

## Day 3 post-surgery

Serum Na+

117 mmol/l

## Day 4 post-surgery

Serum Na+

115 mmol/l

Urinary Na+

25 mmol/l

Serum osmolality

280 mmol/l

Examination of the patient demonstrates dry mucous membranes and delayed capillary refill time.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) SIADH
- b) Diabetes insipidus
- c) Cerebral salt wasting syndrome
- d) Renal tubular acidosis type IV
- e) Sheehan's syndrome

Correct answer is c.

Diabetes insipidus is classically associated with hypernatraemia. Sheehan's syndrome refers to the specific situation of pituitary necrosis following childbirth. The cardinal feature of renal tubular acidosis type IV is hyperkalaemia.

This leaves SIADH and cerebral salt wasting syndrome. The hydration status in this patient can be considered hypovolaemic making SIADH unlikely (typically euvolaemic). Additionally, this diagnosis should only be made in the absence of hypothyroidism and adrenal dysfunction.

Cerebral salt wasting syndrome can occur following neurosurgery. It occurs due to sodium wasting in the urine. Comparatively, it is treated with replacing fluid and sodium losses.

## Question #228

A 38-year-old woman is referred by her GP for management of Graves' disease, diagnosed by the presence of a goitre, suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone, and presence of thyroid antibodies on screening. She has no past medical history of note, drinks 10 units of alcohol per week and smokes 20 cigarettes per day. On examination her blood pressure is 112/88 mmHg, pulse is 89 beats per minute and regular, she has a fine tremor. There is a smooth goitre and marked proptosis.

Which of the following has the greatest negative impact on prognosis of her

## thyroid eye disease?

- a) Alcohol consumption
- b) Cigarette smoking
- c) DR4 HLA type
- d) LATS titre
- e) Use of block replace therapy

Correct answer is b.

Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for the development of thyroid eye disease

A systematic review published in 2006 has confirmed the strong link between cigarette smoking and thyroid eye disease. Across 15 studies a strong association between thyroid eye disease in patients with Graves' disease and smoking was established, with an odds ratio of up to 20 for thyroid eye disease in current smokers vs non-smokers who have Graves'.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16980921

Block replace therapy establishes stable control of thyroid function, and is actually associated with reduced incidence of thyroid eye disease because thyroxine is consistently in the normal range. Alcohol consumption within the recommended safe limits may actually reduce the severity of thyroid eye disease in Graves'. Thyroid eye disease is primarily driven by pathogenic T cells, as such it isn't closely related to LATS titre. HLA DR4 is more strongly associated with Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hepatitis than with thyroid disease.

## Question #229

A 54-year-old woman attends with severe headaches. The headaches have been recurrent and are precipitated by exercise or drinking coffee. She has also felt intolerant to heat and is generally nauseated.

She has a past medical history of anxiety, constipation, and recurrent renal stones.

On examination, she is diaphoretic and tachycardic. There is no focal neurology. She has palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.

Heart rate 120 beats per minute, blood pressure 180/102, SpO2 98% room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, temperature 37.3ºC.

Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following options should form part of the workup for this patient?

- a) MRI head
- b) MRI pancreas
- c) Serum calcitonin
- d) Skeletal survey
- e) Ultrasound adrenals

Correct answer is c.

MEN type II: obtain a thyroid ultrasound and serum calcitonin to exclude medullary thyroid cancer

Here we have a patient presenting with the classic triad of pheochromocytoma hypertension, headaches, and sweating alongside cervical lymphadenopathy and hypercalcemia. The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism. The unifying diagnosis here is MEN type 2A. Up to 100% of patients with MEN type 2A have medullary thyroid cancer at some time in their life and so testing for this is essential.

Serum calcitonin is correct. Alongside a thyroid ultrasound scan, serum calcitonin is required as part of the workup for MEN type II to look for medullary thyroid cancer. Unlike other thyroid cancers, thyroid function tests are usually normal, and presenting features are usually cervical lymphadenopathy or thyroid lumps.

MRI head is incorrect. MEN type 1 is associated with the '3 Ps' - pituitary tumours (most commonly prolactinomas), pancreatic tumours, and parathyroid tumours. In this case, a prolactinoma is unlikely given the normal LH and FSH (prolactin usually suppresses LH and FSH levels) and there are no signs or symptoms of pancreatic tumours and blood glucose levels are normal. MEN type II is more likely. MRI head imaging to look for pituitary tumours is not indicated.

MRI pancreas is incorrect. In this case, there are no signs or symptoms of pancreatic tumour, and blood glucose is normal. This is, therefore, not the most appropriate option.

Skeletal survey is incorrect. This would form part of the workup for multiple myeloma. Although there is hypercalcemia here, there are no other signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma would not explain the headaches precipitated by activity and caffeine. This is, therefore, not the correct answer.

Ultrasound adrenals is incorrect. Adrenal imaging is important in order to assess for pheochromocytoma. Ultrasound, however, is not the appropriate imaging modality - CT scanning is used.

## Question #230

A 24-year-old woman is reviewed in the emergency department. She has presented with vomiting and feeling 'light-headed'. She is known to have a history of Addison's disease and has been unable to take her normal dose of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone over the last five days due to nausea and vomiting. The past medical history includes hypothyroidism and vitiligo.

Her normal medication is:

-  hydrocortisone 10mg, 10mg and 5mg at morning, lunchtime and afternoon
-  fludrocortisone 100 micrograms
-  levothyroxine 100 micrograms

So far she has been given hydrocortisone 100mg IV and 2L of IV fluids, as well as 10mg of metoclopramide IV. Her nausea has settled but she is still struggling to eat or drink. Her systolic blood pressure has increased from 82mmHg to 110mmHg. Capillary glucose is 8.5mmol/l.

She is prescribed regular IV hydrocortisone and anti-emetics.

What further prescription would be appropriate at this stage?

- a) Start oral hydrocortisone
- b) Immediate fludrocortisone
- c) Start insulin on a sliding scale
- d) Further IV fluids

## e) Start IV antibiotics

Correct answer is d.

In an adrenal crisis, hydrocortisone is needed at high dose and fludrocortisone can be omitted as hydrocortisone has mineralocorticoid activity

This is a patient with known Addison's disease who presented unwell having been unable to take regular hydrocortisone doses. The key management is immediate IV hydrocortisone with plenty of IV fluids. When the patient is out of the immediate management stage, feeling better, and able to tolerate oral intake then hydrocortisone can be restarted orally. As this patient has not managed oral intake yet, prescribing oral hydrocortisone may lead to further missed doses. When the patient is having high dose IV hydrocortisone, there is significant mineralocorticoid activity, meaning that fludrocortisone is not needed. She is unlikely to need insulin at all, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with Addison's disease.

## Question #231

A 42-year-old woman is referred to the endocrine clinic. She is treated with lithium for bipolar disorder and presents with weight gain, lethargy, a dry cough and a hoarse voice over the past 3 months. Examination reveals patchy hair loss, a smooth goitre, and she is overweight with a body mass index of 32 kg/m². Her blood pressure is 122/82 mmHg, pulse is 60 beats per minute.

Investigations:

Na

+

130 mmol/l

TSH

14.2 mIU/l

Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage her?

- a) Iodine supplementation
- b) Start prednisolone
- c) Stop lithium
- d) Surgical thyroidectomy
- e) Start thyroxine

Correct answer is e.

Lithium increases intrathyroidal iodine content, inhibits the coupling of iodotyrosine residues to form iodothyronines (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), and it also inhibits release of T4 and T3 leading to hypothyroidism, the clinical picture seen here. The most appropriate intervention is thyroxine supplementation.

There is no need acutely to stop lithium therapy, although substitution may eventually be considered after discussion with the patient's psychiatrist. Due to the fact that lithium prevents coupling of iodotyrosine, iodine supplementation is ineffective. Prednisolone is also not of value because thyroiditis isn't the cause of the hypothyroidism seen here. Surgical thyroidectomy isn't indicated because there are no symptoms of extrinsic airway obstruction.

## Question #232

A 55-year-old female presents with light-headedness and abdominal pain. She has a past medical history of asthma for which she takes regular beclometasone and as required salbutamol. On examination her blood pressure is 95/75 mmHg and heart rate 115 beats per minute.

Blood results are as follows:

What is the most likely cause?

Adrenal Cushing's syndrome3%  Secondary adrenal insufficiency48% Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)21%  Cushing's disease5% Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency23%

The long Synacthen test can be used to distinguish primary adrenal failure from secondary adrenal failure

## Important for me  Less important

The clinical and biochemical results are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. Biochemical results which suggest adrenal insufficiency include hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia.

The short Synacthen test demonstrates failure of cortisol to rise which confirms the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. A normal response is defined as a 30 minute serum cortisol concentration greater than 420 nmol/L.

The next step is to localise the lesion. This can be achieved by measurement of ACTH or by performing the long Synacthen test. Interpretation of this test is governed by the following:

-  1. In primary adrenal failure: we would not expect there to be a significant rise in cortisol during the long Synacthen rest since the adrenal glands are intrinsically dysfunctional
-  2. In secondary adrenal failure: chronically low levels of ACTH due to pituitary failure result in atrophy of the adrenal glands. Prolonged stimulation of the adrenal glands by ACTH in the long Synacthen test results in a degree of recovery by the adrenal glands resulting in a significant rise in cortisol. A response that rises gradually to a peak at 24 hours occurs in secondary adrenal failure. This pattern of results also occurs due to prolonged corticosteroid therapy use.

An important point is to remember that in some cases of long-standing adrenal atrophy due to secondary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands will not respond even after 24 hours and will require several daily doses of depot Synacthen before an adrenal response is seen. The majority of these cases should be identifiable by measurement of plasma ACTH, which would be expected to be very low (in contrast to primary adrenal insufficiency where ACTH levels are very high).

In this case, the long Synacthen test demonstrates a cortisol which rises gradually to a peak at 24 hours confirming the diagnosis of secondary adrenal failure. The differential is now between iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary disease. The patient is on inhaled steroids for asthma, however this is highly unlikely to cause adrenal insufficiency unless the patient was on a liver enzyme inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole). Therefore the most likely diagnosis is secondary adrenal insufficiency.

## Question #233

A 25 year old woman presents to the endocrinology clinic. She is concerned because her father had a 'brain tumour' removed 2 years ago and has now been told he has another tumour in his abdomen after going to his doctor with reflux and indigestion. He has been told it might be a genetic problem and is awaiting testing. She is concerned she might also have the condition and so her GP has referred her to the clinic.

She is currently asymptomatic.

On examination there is no abnormality on the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal or neurological examinations.

The doctor explain that the most appropriate person to see would be the geneticist to whom her father has been referred. He asks her to obtain the details if her father is willing to provide them and says that he will refer her. In the meaning time he offers to carry out some screening blood tests.

Given the likely underlying diagnosis, which of the following is most likely to be abnormal?

## a) Cortisol

- b) Fasting glucose
- c) Parathyroid hormone
- d) Prolactin
- e) Thyroid stimulating hormone

This lady's father is likely to have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) as evidenced by 2 MEN1 associated tumours, a pituitary adenoma and a gastrinoma.

Although this lady is asymptomatic, it is important she is offered genetic screening, as the condition is autosomal dominant.

Fasting glucose, parathyroid hormone and prolactin are all biochemical screening tests used for MEN1 associated tumours (insulinoma, parathyroid adenoma and pituitary adenoma respectively). However, hyperparathyroidism is by far the most common initial manifestation and will eventually develop in 90% of MEN1 patients.

## Question #234

A 9-year-old boy is referred to the department of paediatrics by his general practitioner. He has developed secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 7. He has no significant past medical history and does not take any regular medications. His father commenced puberty at 9 years of age.

On examination, he has a coarse voice and facial hair. His testicles have enlarged. There is acne and adult body odour. The neurological examination is unremarkable. His blood pressure was 155/88 mmHg. There is no rash.

From the listed options, which is the most likely diagnosis?

- a. Brain tumour
- b. Hypothyroidism
- c. Liddle's syndrome
- d. McCune-Albright syndrome
- e. 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency

CAH due to 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency can cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (AMES) resulting in hypertension and hypokalemia

11-beta hydroxylase deficiency is correct. This is the second most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. While CAH typically presents in the neonatal period, non-classical cases may present later with evidence of precocious puberty, such as in this case. Precocious puberty is when puberty occurs before 9 in males. This patient also has evidence of hypokalemia and hypertension, which can occur in this condition. The elevated serum testosterone but normal LH and FSH suggest a peripheral cause of precocious puberty (in this case adrenal) rather than a central cause.

A brain tumour is incorrect. The LH and FSH are normal. We would expect them to be raised with a central cause of precocious puberty.

Hypothyroidism is incorrect. While this can cause precocious puberty, the TSH is within normal limits.

McCune-Albright syndrome is incorrect. This is a cause of precocious puberty but typically it is associated with cafe-au-lait spots, which are absent here.

Liddle's syndrome is incorrect. This is an inherited renal tubular disorder that may cause hypertension and hypokalemia but it does not cause precocious puberty.

## Question #235

A 64-year-old man has been admitted with hypercalcaemia on a background of metastatic prostate cancer. A recent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed multiple bony, sclerotic metastases in the lumbar spine and pelvis.

IV fluids have been given since admission. IV pamidronate 60mg was given 3 days ago and IV denosumab 120mg was given yesterday.

## A trend of adjusted calcium is shown below.

|                  | Day 1       | Day 2       | Day 3       | Today       | Range      |

| Adjusted calcium | 3.32 mmol/L | 3.26 mmol/L | 3.24 mmol/L | 3.16 mmol/L | (2.1- 2.6) |

## The renal function today is shown below.

|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| K+          | 3.7 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Bicarbonate | 23 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |
| Urea        | 8.9 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine  | 132 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

- a) Calcitonin
- b) Further dose of denosumab
- c) Further dose of pamidronate
- d) Indapamide
- e) Prednisolone

Refractory hypercalcaemia of malignancy may be treated with subcutaneous calcitonin if therapy with fluids and pamidronate fails

Calcitonin is the correct answer. Calcitonin has been found to be most useful when combined with hydration, bisphosphonates and/or denosumab, all of which the above patient has received. Calcitonin acts by increasing the excretion of renal calcium and decreasing bone resorption.

Denosumab is commonly used in malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia and can be used in the emergency management of refractory hypercalcaemia. Denosumab can be repeated weekly, therefore given that it was given only the day previously, it is not appropriate to give a further dose of denosumab .

A further dose of pamidronate is inappropriate as the last dose was given 3 days ago. Bisphosphonates take 2-3 days to see an effect and maximal effect may not show until the 7th day.

Loops diuretics can be used in hypercalcaemia, however, thiazide-like diuretics, such as indapamide , are contraindicated as they can worsen hypercalcaemia.

Steroids, such as prednisolone , are not beneficial for hypercalcaemia unless associated with sarcoidosis

## Question #236

A 56-year-old man with type 1 diabetes arrives to hospital with one day of diarrhoea and vomiting. He felt well this morning but suffered indigestion and took some antacids without relief. The indigestion which he describes as a burning pain in the chest spreading into his throat lasted 4 hours however his lunch time blood glucose continued to rise despite several insulin boluses. He has been otherwise well over the past week and denies skipping meals, changes in exercise or any missed doses of his insulin. He smokes twenty cigarettes a day and maintains his diabetes on a basal bolus regime with correction doses based on carbohydrate counting.

On examination, he is sweaty with dry mucosa. His heart rate is 125/min, respiratory rate is 28/min with prolonged expiration phases, blood pressure is 110/90mmHg and temperature is 37ºC.

The nurse does his blood glucose which is 27mmol/l and his blood ketones are 4mmol/l.

What is the likeliest cause that precipitated this presentation?

- a. Missed insulin dose
- b. Faulty blood glucose monitor
- c. Lower respiratory tract infection
- d. Myocardial infarction
- e. Gastritis

Answer is D.

Myocardial infarction can precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis

This patient is a well controlled type 1 diabetic presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with no clear precipitant. Given a normal HbA1c and denial of any lifestyle changes, we should assume that he has not just missed his insulin. The blood glucose monitors are very reliable these days and rarely are wrong. Gastritis would not cause DKA. Myocardial infarction (MI) and lower respiratory tract infections can both precipitate DKA and given the burning chest pain and ECG changes, it would be warranted to do a troponin immediately as an MI this is the likeliest cause of DKA. To remember the causes of DKA, think 3 'I's which are insulin (missed), infection or infarction (i.e. MI).

## Question #237

A 58 year-old man presents with a two month history of weight loss and a one week history of increasing confusion. His partner reports that his clothes are now loose on him and that he has started to forget things and that he has been unable to reach for objects off the top shelf at the supermarket over the last two months due to increasing weakness. Six weeks ago he had been treated for an islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas with chemotherapy and has no other past medical history.

Examination reveals an abbreviated mental test score of 5/10 and weakness in the shoulders and getting out of the chair. Heart sounds 1 and 2 are present with no added sounds, his chest is clear and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Observations reveal a blood pressure of 158/95 mmHg, a pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, a temperature of 37.5ºC and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Random blood glucose is 16.2 mmol/L.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

| γGT        | 47 u/l        |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Paraneoplastic encephalitis
- b) Cerebral metastases
- c) Post chemotherapy Cushing's syndrome
- d) Post chemotherapy hypothyroidism
- e) Ectopic ACTH secretion

The correct answer is E.

The confusion, hypertension and proximal myopathy, along with the hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia all point towards a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. The subtype is most likely ectopic secretion of ACTH by the islet cell carcinoma, a neuroendocrine tumour and can release ectopic hormones. The post-chemotherapy Cushing's syndrome is unlikely, as the chemotherapy started after the proximal myopathy had begun to take effect. Further, in ectopic ACTH secretion, the hypokalaemia tends to be more pronounced, as in this case

## Question #238

| Creatinine  | 65 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |

| Aldosterone   | 680 pmol/L   | (100-450)   |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Renin         | 0.3 mU/L     | (5.4-30)    |

A saline infusion test is completed and the results post-infusion are as follows:

The patient is keen to undergo surgical management of his condition if possible.

What investigation would be the most reliable in confirming the location of the lesion in this case?

- a. Adrenal venous sampling
- b. Delayed contrast-enhanced CT adrenals
- c. Fine-needle aspiration adrenal biopsy
- d. MRI adrenals
- e. MRI brain

The correct answer is A.

Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be used to distinguish between unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia in primary hyperaldosteronism

The most likely diagnosis here is hyperaldosteronism. Adrenal adenomas and adrenal hyperplasia are the most common causes. Secondary hyperaldosteronism can occur due to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system overactivity as seen in cardiac failure, ascites, and fibromuscular dysplasia. In this case, renin is suppressed, so primary hyperaldosteronism is the most likely answer.

Adrenal venous sampling is the correct answer. This involves sampling blood from the adrenal veins and assessing the levels of aldosterone. This is the goldstandard test to distinguish between unilateral adrenal adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia and should be completed to confirm the location of the abnormality if surgery is to be considered. CT scanning can help identify lesions, however, many adrenal adenomas are non-functioning and not clinically relevant. Hormonal studies via AVS are therefore advised to confirm the location to avoid the removal of an adrenal gland unnecessarily.

Delayed contrast-enhanced CT adrenals is incorrect. Although CT scanning is a good modality to look for adrenal pathology many adrenal adenomas can be too small to pick up on CT. CT can also pick up incidental adenomas that are nonfunctioning and of no clinical consequence. CT is therefore not the most reliable modality to use to confirm the location of the lesion.

Fine-needle aspiration adrenal biopsy is incorrect. Adrenal adenomas are usually extremely small and not amenable to biopsy.

MRI adrenals is incorrect. Although MRI can be used, there are similar pitfalls to CT scanning as detailed above - MRI may pick up non-functioning adrenal adenomas or miss small adenomas.

MRI brain is incorrect. Pituitary lesions are not implicated in primary hyperaldosteronism.

## Question #239

A 54-year-old woman has attended a follow-up endocrinology clinic after undergoing investigations for hyperthyroidism. She initially presented with a 4month history of intermittent palpitations, sweating, and fatigue. She had noticed that over this time she had developed a tremor and had lost approximately 6kg in weight.

Thyroid function tests from today's clinic are shown below.

| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   | 0.01 mU/L (0.5-5.5)    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Free thyroxine (T4)                 | 28.3 pmol/L (9.0 - 18) |

Images from her nuclear scintigraphy are also available.



Which of the following is the most likely cause for this woman's presentation?

- a) Grave's disease
- b) Hashimoto's thyroiditis
- c) Solitary toxic nodule
- d) Follicular thyroid cancer
- e) Toxic multinodular goitre

The answer is E.

The nuclear scintigraphy images show multiple localised areas of increased uptake throughout both lobes of a normal-sized thyroid gland. This, along with the symptoms and thyroid function tests, would be in keeping with toxic multinodular goitre.

The appearance of Grave's disease commonly displays homogenous uptake throughout the whole thyroid gland, which itself will be enlarged.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis can vary with its appearance on nuclear scintigraphy, thus being an option using images alone. However, this patient has symptoms of hyperthyroidism along with thyroid function tests that confirm this. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is more likely to lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.

A solitary toxic nodule shows a single, defined area of increased iodine uptake on nuclear scintigraphy.

Follicular thyroid cancer is not correct as it does not commonly show evidence of increased uptake of iodine on nuclear scintigraphy. Symptoms are also rare with the most common being that of a noticeable lump in the thyroid gland

## Question #240

A 19-year-old gentleman with a background history of asthma presents to the Emergency Department complaining of leg weakness and the inability to walk. He had run a marathon the day before. On examination, there is 3/5 weakness of the leg extensors bilaterally. Tone, reflexes and coordination are unimpaired and plantars are downgoing bilaterally. Straight leg raise and sensation to light touch and pain stimulus are unimpaired.

Blood tests show the following:

| Hb   | 13.4g/dl    |
|------|-------------|
| WBC  | 6.2 x 109/l |
| Na+  | 136mmol/l   |
| K+   | 2.9mmol/l   |
| Urea | 6.8mmol/l   |

Creatinine

104µmol/l

What is the most appropriate treatment in this case?

- a. Oral potassium and encourage bed rest
- b. Hourly forced vital capacity measurements and plasma exchange
- c. Oral potassium and encourage gentle exercise
- d. Hourly forced vital capacity measurements and IV immunoglobulin
- e. Plasma exchange and oral potassium supplementation

The correct answer is C.

Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is a rare autosomal dominant periodic paralysis but can also occur as a result of a spontaneous mutation (a third of cases have no family history). Attacks often occur in the morning with a history of strenuous exercise or a high carbohydrate meal the day before or may be provoked by stress eg. infections, lack of sleep. Weakness can range from an isolated muscle group to generalised weakness and tends to affect proximal muscles first.

Serum potassium decreases during attacks but may not necessarily fall below the normal range (3.5 -5mmol/l).

The mainstay of treatment for an acute attack is oral potassium supplementation and encouragement of gentle exercise. Intravenous potassium is reserved for those unable to swallow or with cardiac arrhythmias. Acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide are used as first-line prophylactic agents

## Question #241

A 56-year-old lady presents with a 3 month history of abdominal pains, low mood and constipation. Past medical history includes hypertension and depression following the death of her husband 2 years ago. Routine blood tests are performed by the GP and upon review the patient is referred into hospital.

## Blood tests are as below:

| Hb                 | 100 g/l     | Na+        | 135 mmol/l   |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets          | 230 * 109/l | K+         | 4.7 mmol/l   |
| WBC                | 10 * 109/l  | Urea       | 6 mmol/l     |
| Calcium (adjusted) | 2.96 mmol/l | Creatinine | 110 µmol/l   |
| Phosphate          | 1.35 mmol/l | CRP        | 30 mg/l      |
| Albumin            | 35 g/L      |            |              |

## Which diagnostic test should be performed first?

- a) Parathyroid hormone level
- b) Myeloma screen
- c) CT chest, abdomen and pelvis
- d) Urinary calcium levels
- e) Skeletal X-ray

The correct answer is A.

The two main causes of hypercalcaemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Parathyroid hormone level will help to differentiate between these two main differentials and help guide further investigations

## Question #242

A surgical Foundation Year 1 doctor (FY1) asks you to review a preoperative ECG for a 19-year-old patient who has been admitted under their team with suspected appendicitis. The only abnormality is a prolonged QT and you note the adjusted calcium to be 2.02 mmol/l.

The FY1 tells you that when they looked at the patients closed fists the outer two knuckles looked like dimples. She also tells you that the patient's body mass index is 29 kg/m².

You ask her to order some blood tests which come back as follows:

| Adjusted calcium   | 2.02 mmol/l                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PTH                | 69 pmol/L (normal range = 0.8 - 8.5) |
| Phosphate          | 2.0 mmol/l                           |
| ALP                | 130 u/l                              |

What is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's hypocalcaemia?

- a. Hypoparathyroidism
- b. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a
- c. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b
- d. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism
- e. Secondary hyperparathyroidism

The answer is B.

Short fifth metacarpals, short stature, learning difficulties + ↑ PTH, ↓ calcium, ↑ phosphate → pseudohypoparathyroidism

This patient has a high PTH, a low calcium, a high phosphate and a normal ALP. The patient is also obese and the dimples on the outer two knuckles are likely to represent shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals. This biochemistry in combination of these clinical features is characteristic of pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1a (Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy).

Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism would have the same clinical features but would have normal biochemistry. Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1b would have the same biochemistry but lack the clinical features.

This patient has a high PTH, therefore this immediately excludes hypoparathyroidism. In secondary hyperparathyroidism the ALP would be elevated therefore this is incorrect

## Question #243

A 16-year-old male presents with 3 months of chronic headaches and visual blurring. He has no past medical history and no known family history. On examination, his heart sounds are normal with no added sounds and the respiratory examination is unremarkable. He has no focal neurological signs. Fundoscopy reveals papilloedema, hard exudates and flame haemorrhage. His blood pressure is 226/160mmHg. His blood tests and arterial blood gas are as follows:

| Na+        | 145 mmol/l   |
|------------|--------------|
| K+         | 2.9 mmol/l   |
| Urea       | 5.4 mmol/l   |
| Creatinine | 72 µmol/l    |

| pH    | 7.49    |
|-------|---------|
| PaO2  | 13kPa   |
| PaCO2 | 3.4 kPa |

Bicarbonat e

34 mmol/L

| Serum ambulatory renin activity   | 0.2 pmol/L @3-4 hours (normal range 0.8-3.5 pmol/ml/hr)   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Serum ambulatory aldosterone      | 24 pmol/L@ 3-4 hours (normal range 100-800)               |

What is the optimal long-term treatment?

- a) Amlodipine
- b) Ramipril
- c) Atenolol
- d) Doxazosin
- e) Amiloride

The correct answer is E.

The patient is young and presents with grade 4 hypertensive retinopathic changes associated with a systolic of over 200mmHg, associated with hypokalaemia and a metabolic alkalosis. Importantly, both renin and aldosterone are decreased, ruling out primary hyperaldosteronism. The diagnosis is thus likely to be Liddle's syndrome, a genetic disorder of ENaC channels in the collecting duct, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and increased potassium excretion. The treatment is with amiloride, a potassium sparing diuretic that directly blocks collecting tubule sodium channels and resolves hypertension.

## Question #244

A 54-year-old woman was admitted following abnormal blood tests on routine monitoring. She is currently undergoing palliative chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX, a combination of folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin for metastatic pancreatic cancer. She has suffered from diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and fatigue since starting treatment. She has a past medical history of hypothyroidism, epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Her regular medications include levothyroxine, levetiracetam, lithium, loperamide, paracetamol, oramorph, zomorph, movicol and ondansetron.

Na+

142mmol/l

K+

3.8mmol/l

Urea

4.4mmol/l

Creatinine

83µmol/l

Corrected calcium

3.3µmol/l

She is started on treatment with IV 0.9% saline and given 90mg of IV alendronate after further blood tests are sent for, and an ECG is done. Which of her regular medications should not be prescribed on admission?

- a. Zomorph

- b. Levetiracetam

- c. Loperamide

- d. Levothyroxine

- e. Lithium

The correct answer is E.

This patient has developed hypercalcaemia in the context of cancer but whilst also taking lithium. Lithium can be a cause of elevated calcium and should, therefore, be held in the acute context until the cause of hypercalcaemia is established. Note that the serum concentration of lithium does not correlate with the likelihood of it being a cause of hypercalcaemia. In the context of new confusion or dehydration, withholding the opiate medications would have been reasonable.

## Question #245

A 45-year-old woman with chronic alcohol abuse admitted 3 days ago for nausea and severe diarrhoea now complains of peri-oral and finger tingling. She was admitted for hydration after 1 week of severe watery diarrhoea. She has been receiving intravenous hydration and dextrose but has not been able to take oral nutrition secondary to continued nausea. Her blood pressure is 130/74 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. She is afebrile.

Physical examination is significant for facial twitching on percussion of her facial nerve just anterior to the ear, as well as the induction of carpal spasm after the inflation of a blood pressure cuff on her arm.

Which of the following is most likely to have caused these findings?

- a) Hyperuricaemia
- b) Hypernatraemia
- c) Hypomagnesaemia
- d) Hypophosphataemia
- e) Hypouricaemia

Magnesium deficiency causes hypocalcaemia

This patient is displaying classic signs of hypocalcaemia, including hyperexcitability of her facial nerve (Chvostek's sign), induced carpal spasm (Trousseau's sign), and tingling of the extremities and lips. Calcium homeostasis is a complicated process involving PTH, vitamin D, albumin and numerous electrolytes. Acquired hypoparathyroidism is the most common form of true hypocalcaemia, most often occurring transiently after thyroid surgery or after the removal of a parathyroid adenoma. Occasionally, hypomagnesaemia can produce hypocalcaemia by decreasing both the body's production of PTH and its sensitivity to the hormone. In this case, it is likely that the patient became magnesium depleted from her course of watery diarrhoea, likely baseline poor nutritional status and alcohol abuse.

Choice 1: Hyperuricaemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Chronic kidney disease, however can lead to hypocalcaemia in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but there is no evidence of renal failure in this patient.

Choice 2: Fluid balance (hyper- or hyponatraemia) does not play a role in calcium homeostasis.

Choice 4: Hypophosphataemia is not a cause of hypocalcaemia. Actually, hypocalcaemia often leads to hyperphosphataemia secondary to increased PTHmediated bone resorption. Elevations in phosphate may also contribute to hypocalcaemia by complexing with circulating calcium and suppressing conversion of 25-OH to 1, 25-OH vitamin D.

Choice 5: Urate levels do not affect calcium homeostasis

## Question #246

A 42 year-old man presents to his GP with a 3 month history of increasing anxiety. On further questioning, he has lost 6 kg of weight over the past 2 months and has been experiencing increased bowel movements and diarrhoea.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

| Hb                                | 14.2 g/dL   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Platelets                         | 210 * 109/l |
| WBC                               | 6.9 * 109/l |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 0.08 mu/l   |

| Free thyroxine (T4)         | 17.4 pmol/l   |                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Total triiodothyronine (T3) | 13.4 nmol/l   | Normal range (4.0-8.3 nmol/l) |

What is the most appropriate treatment?

- a. Reassurance
- b. Carbimazole
- c. Radio-iodine
- d. Surgery
- e. Propranolol

The answer is B.

The diagnosis in this scenario is triiodothyronine thyrotoxicosis. A small subset of those patients experiencing thyrotoxicosis (roughly 5%) have isolated triiodothyronine thyrotoxicosis. As with other types of thyrotoxicosis, carbimazole is the main initial treatment for the condition

## Question #247

A 55-year-old woman is admitted following a fall whilst ice-skating, landing on her wrist and hitting her head on the ice. She felt slightly dizzy before the fall and has felt 'not quite right' for many months and was admitted to the hospital 1 month prior due to nephrolithiasis.

An x-ray confirms a scaphoid fracture. A CT head was unremarkable.

From the following options, what would be the most likely cause of her biochemical abnormalities?

- a) Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency
- b) Fanconi syndrome
- c) Hypoaldosteronism
- d) Sjogren's syndrome
- e) Topiramate use

Type 1 ( distal ) renal tubular acidosis may be caused by Sjogren's syndrome

This patient has an unexplained metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia. If we calculate the anion gap we get a value of 10.6, indicating that this is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA).

## Causes of NAGMA include:

-  Acetazolamide use
-  Topiramate use
-  Renal tubular acidosis type 1 and type 2
-  Diarrhoea
-  Ureterosigmoidostomy
-  Post hypocapnic state

Sjogren's syndrome is correct. This is the only option that can cause type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is characterised by NAGMA, hypokalemia (due to renal potassium loss), high urinary pH (due to inability to acidify urine), and can also be a cause of renal stones. Type 1 RTA can be the first presentation of Sjogren's, so these patients should have autoimmune screening - anti-Ro-, anti-La, rheumatoid factor, and ANA.

Fanconi syndrome is incorrect. Although Fanconi syndrome can show NAGMA and hypokalemia, you would not expect to acidification of the urine as it is associated with type 2 RTA.

Hypoaldosteronism is incorrect. Hypoaldosteronism is associated with type 4 RTA and you would see hyperkalemia as aldosterone usually increases potassium excretion via the cortical collecting ducts.

Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency is incorrect. This is a very rare condition and is associated with a mixed type 3 RTA picture. It would not explain nephrolithiasis and is not the most likely answer.

Topiramate use is incorrect. This is associated with type 2 RTA. You would not expect to see acidification of the urine as it is associated with type 2 RTA

## Question #248

You are called to urgently review a 45-year-old woman in the emergency department. She presented earlier in the day with fever, a productive cough and confusion. She had been diagnosed by the emergency department doctors as having community acquired pneumonia after seeing consolidation on her chest Xray and sepsis secondary to this with associated delirium. Collateral history from her partner establishes that she had been feeling unwell for two days with a cough and become increasingly unwell, confused and agitated. The partner also explained that she had recently been diagnosed with an overactive thyroid and been told to start urgently on anti-thyroid tablets, but had not done so when she had read the label of these tablets and found that they should not be taken during pregnancy and she is trying to become pregnant. She had been taking paracetamol only for fever.

Despite treating with IV co-amoxiclav and oral clarithromycin and fluid resuscitation with three liters of fluid as well as IV paracetamol the patient has not improved.

On examination she is very agitated and aggressive and is difficult to examine. She feels very hot and clammy to touch, but peripheries are well perfused. Auscultation shows left sided crepitations. Her heart rate is 170 bpm, blood pressure 81/40 mmHg, temperature 39.2ºC, oxygen saturations 100% on 2L via nasal cannulae.

Blood tests from this admission are still pending. Out-patient blood tests show a undetectable low TSH two weeks ago, as well as a free T4 of 53mmol/ml.

What is the most appropriate immediate treatment?

- a. Change to IV meropenem and monitor
- b. Start carbimazole
- c. Urgent referral for thyroidectomy
- d. Start IV propranolol
- e. IV adenosine

Answer is D.

In thyroid storm with IV beta-blockers are a important first-line treatment

This is a patient with severe confusion, fever and evidence of chest infection and untreated hyperthyroidism. The clinical history suggests that she has developed a thyroid storm as she has fever, severe tachycardia, confusion and agitation with hyperthyroidism. This is a medical emergency, and the most urgent matter is to control her heart rate which is likely the cause for her low blood pressure. IV beta-blocker should be started for this purpose, and propranolol would further help reduce the conversion of T3 into T4. In addition, fluids and dexamethasone should be given, as well as anti-thyroid medications.

Changing to meropenem is unlikely to add any further benefit as the effects of the co-amoxiclav probably have not been seen yet. As the patient is not stable it is not appropriate to refer for surgery as management, but may be a viable longterm strategy to treat her hyperthyroidism. Starting carbimazole now is not the most appropriate action as the patient is unstable and this needs to be corrected first. Adenosine is would be appropriate for a patient with SVT without infection and thyrotoxicosis

## Question #249

A 28-year-old man presents to the clinic for review of his familial hypercholesterolaemia. He is currently on 80mg once daily atorvastatin.

His blood results are as follows:

| Hb        | 135 g/l      | Na+        | 138 mmol/l   |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelets | 322 * 109/l  | K+         | 4.6 mmol/l   |
| WBC       | 10.5 * 109/l | Urea       | 6.6 mmol/l   |
| Neuts     | 6.2 * 109/l  | Creatinine | 72 µmol/l    |

| Total cholesterol   | 7.5 mmol/L (normal range < 5)   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| LDL cholesterol     | 5.5 mmol/L (normal range < 3)   |

What treatment would you begin?

- a) Fenofibrate
- b) Nicotinic acid
- c) Ezetimibe
- d) Evolocumab
- e) Cholestyramine

The answer is C.

First line management for familial hypercholesterolaemia is high dose statins. Ezetimibe is used as a second line agent

High dose statin therapy is first line for familial hypercholesterolaemia.

If serum total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration is not appropriately controlled on statin therapy, then the second line agent ezetimibe can be co-administered with the statin. Ezetimibe acts by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the small intestine

## Question #250

A 45-year-old man presents to the endocrine clinic for review. He has had 3 stones in weight gain over the past 6 months and his GP is concerned about a possible diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and has checked an initial 24hr urinary free cortisol which is elevated. He is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg, his pulse is 75 beats per minute and regular. His body mass index is 35 kg/m² and there are obvious abdominal striae. Which of the following would be most suggestive of an adrenal adenoma producing cortisol?

- a. Normal 9am serum cortisol
- b. Raised urinary free cortisol on repeat testing
- c. Serum cortisol of 220 mmol/l at 9am after an overnight dexamethasone suppression test
- d. Serum potassium of 2.4 mmol/l
- e. Undetectable levels of ACTH6

The answer is E.

The key fact is that an adrenal adenoma producing cortisol would suppress the release of ACTH. For this reason, if ACTH is undetectable then an adrenal tumour is the most likely cause. In this case, a CT abdomen would be the obvious next step.

Normal 9 am serum cortisol would make a diagnosis of Cushing's less likely, and a raised urinary free cortisol on repeat testing is not specific for the underlying cause. Failure to suppress after overnight dexamethasone suppression test merely confirms a diagnosis of Cushing's. Serum potassium levels as low as 2.4 mmol/l would be very unusual in a case of Cushing's.

## Question #251

A 38-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient department by her GP with pain in her calves when walking 50 meters. She reports no other symptoms and has no other past medical history other than migraine. She is on no regular medication and her family history includes her mother having diabetes and her father dying of a heart attack aged 46. She currently smokes 35 cigarettes per day and drinks a glass of wine every evening. Her occupation is as a financial advisor.

Examination reveals tendon xanthomas affecting the extensor tendons of his fingers. On examining her face, it is noticed she has xanthelasma around both eyes and corneal arcs.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Tangier disease
- b) Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia
- c) Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia
- d) Familial hypertriglyceridaemia
- e) Apo CII deficiency

Answer is C.

This patient's symptoms suggest intermittent claudication and combined with the signs of hypercholesterolaemia especially the tendon xanthomas would suggest one of the familial hypercholesterolaemias. Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, present with early cardiovascular disease, sometimes as early as the second decade of life, whereas, patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia rarely present before the age 30. Thus, this case is more suggestive of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.

In heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, total cholesterol would typically be above 7.9 mmol/l, with normal triglyceride levels. In homozygotes it is typically above 15 mmol/l

## Question #252

A 67-year-old man with a history of ischaemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus is noted to have non-visible haematuria during an annual review. He is currently feeling well and is asymptomatic. The urine dipstick showed blood ++, with no protein and no leucocytes. This result is repeated one week later.

His current medications include aspirin, bisoprolol, atorvastatin, ramipril, metformin and pioglitazone.

Which one of the following drugs should be stopped whilst awaiting further investigations?

- a. Aspirin
- b. Ramipril
- c. Atorvastatin
- d. Metformin
- e. Pioglitazone

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer

The correct answer is Pioglitazone . Pioglitazone, an oral antidiabetic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. In the presence of non-visible haematuria (blood in urine), this medication should be discontinued until further investigations are completed.

Aspirin is not typically associated with haematuria and its use as antiplatelet therapy in a patient with ischemic heart disease should not be interrupted without a compelling reason.

Ramipril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is used for hypertension and cardiac conditions. While it can occasionally cause renal impairment leading to proteinuria, it does not typically cause haematuria.

Atorvastatin , a statin used for hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular risk reduction, may have some side effects such as myopathy or liver dysfunction but it is not commonly associated with haematuria.

Finally, Metformin , another oral antidiabetic agent, can lead to lactic acidosis in cases of renal insufficiency but it does not usually cause haematuria. Therefore, there would be no need to stop metformin based on the given clinical scenario

## Question #253

A 65-year-old man who is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus presents for advice. He is a Muslim and is considering fasting for Ramadan. His diabetes is currently controlled with a combination of diet and metformin 500mg tds. Looking at his records the last HbA1c was 6.4% (46 mmol/mol). If he decides to fast during Ramadan, what is the most appropriate advice to give regarding his metformin?

- a) Metformin should be stopped
- b) Metformin 1.5g after sunset
- c) Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset
- d) Metformin 500mg after sunset
- e) Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset

During Ramadan, one-third of the normal metformin dose should be taken before sunrise and two-thirds should be taken after sunset

The correct answer is Metformin 500mg before sunrise, 1g after sunset . This is because during Ramadan, individuals who fast are required to refrain from consuming food and drink from sunrise to sunset. In order to maintain adequate glycaemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia, it is recommended that metformin be taken in a divided dose - a smaller dose before sunrise (predawn meal or Suhoor) and a larger dose after sunset (evening meal or Iftar). This allows for better distribution of the medication throughout the day while still adhering to the fasting requirements.

Metformin should be stopped is incorrect because stopping metformin abruptly may result in poor glycaemic control and increased risk of hyperglycaemia. It is important for patients with diabetes to continue their medications during Ramadan, with appropriate adjustments made under medical supervision.

Metformin 1.5g after sunset is not the best option because taking the entire daily dose at once can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and may not provide optimal glycaemic control throughout the day. Dividing the dose as mentioned earlier helps maintain better blood glucose levels during fasting hours.

Metformin 500mg after sunset is also incorrect because this dosing regimen significantly reduces the total daily dose of metformin compared to his current regimen, which may lead to inadequate glycaemic control. Additionally, it does not account for any pre-dawn medication intake.

Finally, Metformin 1g before sunrise, 500mg after sunset is not ideal as it provides a higher dose before sunrise than necessary. The recommended approach is to take a smaller dose before sunrise and a larger one after sunset in order to minimize potential hypoglycaemia during fasting hours while maintaining adequate glycaemic control

## Question # 254

A 29-year-old female is admitted to the Emergency Department following an episode of collapse. She denies prodromal symptoms and woke up after an undetermined period to find herself lying face down on the ground. She has recently consulted her GP regarding feelings of generalised weakness, intermittent palpitations and dizziness.

Her past medical history is remarkable for hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis, previously managed with infliximab, and complicated 3 months ago by a diagnosis of TB. Her regular medications include methotrexate, folic acid, levothyroxine, artificial tears, rifampicin, and isoniazid.

During the examination, the patient complains of recurrent palpitations. The cardiac monitor shows broad-complex tachycardia. Her blood pressure is stable at 117/68mmHg and she is given a bolus of amiodarone.

Her venous blood gas is as follows:

| pH       | 7.31        |
|----------|-------------|
| pCO2     | 4.3 kPa     |
| pO2      | 6.3 kPa     |
| Na+      | 137 mmol/l  |
| K+       | 2.1 mmol/l  |
| Cl-      | 114 mmol/l  |
| iCa2+    | 1.05 mmol/l |
| Glucos e | 5.4 mmol/l  |
| HCO3     | 15.6 mmol/l |
| BE       | -9.5 mmol/l |

Some additional investigations are requested:

| Urine dipstick   | pH 5.0 glucose ++ protein +                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| XR chest         | unremarkable                                                          |
| XR abdomen       | normal bowel gas pattern, no evidence of abnormal renal calcification |

What is the most likely cause of the metabolic abnormalities described?

- a. Addison's disease
- b. Fanconi syndrome
- c. Rheumatoid arthritis
- d. Sjogren's syndrome
- e. Liver cirrhosis

Answer is B.

The patient has a normal anion gap hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis associated with hypokalaemia. This, in combination with the absence of GI symptoms, should alert you to the possibility of underlying renal tubular acidosis.

Fanconi syndrome is a disorder of proximal renal tubular function that leads to abnormal loss of bicarbonate, glucose, potassium, phosphate, uric acid and amino acids in the urine. Patients have features of type 2 renal tubular acidosis, accompanied by hypophosphataemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Presenting features include polyuria, polydipsia, osteomalacia (rickets and growth failure in children) and symptoms secondary to the electrolyte abnormalities associated with the disorder. Rifampicin has recently been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and is the most likely cause in this case.

Rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome are causes of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis; a failure of hydrogen ion secretion in the distal tubule that causes hypokalaemia and nephrocalcinosis. The absence of abnormal renal calcification on the patient's x-ray points away from this as the diagnosis.

Addison's disease typically causes hyperkalaemia, often associated with other electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia and hypoglycaemia. It would, therefore, be inconsistent with the biochemistry provided.

Liver cirrhosis does not typically cause renal tubular acidosis unless it is itself a manifestation of Wilson's disease. There is nothing in the question to suggest Wilson's disease as the underlying diagnosis, however, and the occurrence of this pattern of metabolic abnormality would still be predicated on the development of a complicating Fanconi syndrome

## Question # 255

A 29-year-old man with known Addison's disease contacts his endocrinologist. He has signed up for a marathon and is wondering what to do with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for the event. He is normally fit and well without any other medical problems. His diagnosis was established five years ago and since then he has had two admissions due to an inability of taking hydrocortisone and now has emergency doses of IM hydrocortisone. What is the most appropriate advice to give?

- a) Take doses as normal for the marathon
- b) Double the hydrocortisone dose but not the fludrocortisone dose for the marathon
- c) Double the fludrocortisone dose but not hydrocortisone dose for the marathon
- d) Double both the fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose for the marathon
- e) Omit both medications for the marathon Answer is B.

A patient with Addisons' disease who undertakes significantly strenuous activity should double the dose of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoids

This is a patient with Addison's disease who is planning significantly strenuous activity. In such a situation, both fludrocortisone dose and the hydrocortisone dose should be doubled, with advice to increase fluid intake as well. If the patient was just on hydrocortisone then no additional fludrocortisone would be needed.

Glucocorticoid therapy should ideally mimic endogenous cortisol rhythm with the lowest level at time of falling asleep and highest at waking. Treatment should aim to control symptoms at the smallest dose possible. Hydrocortisone has a short half-life but excellent bioavailibility.

Mineralocorticoid therapy will be eventually required in adrenal insufficiency to counter intravascular volume depletion. It is important in the presence of increased fluid loss that the mineralocorticoid dose is adjusted. This is why doubling of the dose is advised.

If less strenuous activity, such as a long hike, was planned than increasing the dose of hydrocortisone by 5-10mg would be reasonable, without any change in fludrocortisone. This change would also apply for any day that increased activity is planned for. They should also be advised to increase fluid intake in the proportion to the increase in hydrocortisone dose.

If a patient is taking an alternative steroid regime, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, then endocrinology advise would be needed.

Omitting any medications could be dangerous and precipitate an Addisonian crisis.

## Question #256

You review a 28-year-old woman who is 26 weeks pregnant. She has just had a routine oral glucose tolerance test as her BMI is 34 kg/m². The following results were obtained:

Time (hours)

Blood glucose (mmol/l)

|   0 |   7.4 |
|-----|-------|
|   2 |  11.2 |

There have been no other antenatal problems and her anomaly scan was normal. What is the most appropriate action?

- a. Repeat oral glucose tolerance test in 4 weeks
- b. Start metformin + advice about diet / exercise + self-monitor glucose levels
- c. Advice about diet / exercise + self-monitor glucose levels
- d. Start insulin + advice about diet / exercise + self-monitor glucose levels
- e. Reassure results within normal limits

Answer is D.

NICE have recently changed their gestational diabetes guidelines. Insulin should be started in the fasting glucose is &gt;= 7 mmol/l. Aspirin should also be considered given the increased risk of pre-eclampsia

## Question #257

An 18-year-old male with no prior medical history is admitted to the resuscitation room of Emergency Department where you are asked to assess him. He is noted to be hypotensive, tachycardic and febrile. Further assessment highlights a widespread, non-blanching, purple rash. He is diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia and is treated appropriately. Nevertheless, his condition deteriorates further when he also develops Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. Which of the following sets of blood results would be most consistent with his condition at this point?

- a) Na+ 147mmol/L, K+ 5.8mmol/L, Glucose 7.5mmol/L

b)

Na+ 147mmol/L, K+ 3.0mmol/L, Glucose 2.0mmol/L

- c) Na+ 129mmol/L, K+ 5.8mmol/L, Glucose 2.0mmol/L
- d) Na+ 147mmol/L, K+ 5.8mmol/L, Glucose 11.5mmol/L
- e) Na+ 129mmol/L, K+ 5.8mmol/L, Glucose 11.5mmol/L

## Answer is C.

Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is defined as adrenal failure due to bleeding into the adrenal glands (otherwise referred to as haemorrhagic adrenalitis) and is most commonly caused by meningococcal septicaemia.

The biochemical pattern which results is analogous to that seen in an Addisonian crisis, and so you would expect to see hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hypoglycaemia

## Question #258

A 35-year-old woman presents with weight gain for the last couple of years. She feels that most weight has been gained on her face and abdomen. On further questioning, her periods have been irregular for some time. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus last year. The patient drinks approximately 15 units of alcohol per day.

On examination, she has violaceous striae across the abdomen. Proximal muscle weakness is also evident when asking the patient to stand. Blood tests are taken:

| Na +   | 143 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| K+     | 2.8 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |

The team suspects that the patient's alcohol use may be the underlying cause of her presentation, rather than an endogenous cause, and want to differentiate the two.

What is the most appropriate investigation?

- a. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- b. Insulin stress test
- c. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- d. Petrosal sinus sampling
- e. Short synacthen test

The insulin tolerance test can be used to distinguish Cushing's syndrome from pseudo-Cushing's

## Important for me  Less important

This patient may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome as a result of alcohol use, as opposed to true Cushing's syndrome. Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome display clinical and biochemical features similar to those seen in Cushing's syndrome, such as the scenario here, but the presentation is caused by alcohol abuse, rather than an endogenous source or steroid use. Other causes of pseudoCushing's include severe depression, eating disorders, and chronic illness. Of the options listed above, the insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic sources of Cushing's syndrome. It is not useful in pseudo-Cushing's.

The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used as a first-line test for patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome. It will not help to differentiate between Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.

Petrosal sinus sampling is performed for patients with confirmed ACTHdependent Cushing's syndrome without an obvious pituitary lesion on MRI. Blood is sampled peripherally and from the inferior petrosal sinuses and the ratio of ACTH is measured. It is not useful to distinguish Cushing's from pseudo-Cushing's.

The short synacthen test is not relevant here. It is involved in the diagnosis of Addison's disease, rather than Cushing's syndrome.

## Question #259

A 22 year old lady presents over a year with mild-moderate, intermittent abdominal pain. She has felt low in mood over this period and also her periods have stopped. Her history includes two previous attacks of renal calculi formation managed conservatively. She had a car crash recently, where she says that the car just 'came out of nowhere'. She is intermittently getting global headaches that can be very severe in nature but are otherwise featureless. On prompting, she tells you that she has sometimes noticed a white nipple discharge on her clothing. She has had low blood pressure and several faints over this last year and after her GP discovered a low serum cortisol level he has started her on oral hydrocortisone and referred her to your clinic. On examination today her blood pressure 130/80. She has a blistering, red rash across her lower abdomen and back. Her abdomen is largely non-tender with no palpable organomegally or peritonism. Visual fields are reduced bitemporally. Her urine dipstick shows glycosuria. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is likely to treat the underlying condition most effectively?

- a) Bisphosphonates
- b) Surgery
- c) Cabergoline
- d) Octreotide
- e) Insulin

The unifying diagnosis here is is multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas.

This patient has symptoms of hypercalcaemia (abdominal groans, renal stones, and psychic moans of the 'bones, stones, groans, psychic moans'). This can be caused by a parathyroid tumour. She has symptoms suggestive of a non- functioning pituitary macro-adenoma causing hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea and galactorrhoea) and hypopituitarism presenting as Addison's from suppressed ACTH. Dopamine is the inhibitor of prolactin in the pituitary, and comes from the hypothalamus. A nonfunctioning pituitary macro-adenoma compresses the pituitary stalk, interrupting dopamine flow to the pituitary, and therefore abolishing dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin, resulting in hyperprolactinaemia. At the same time, the macro-adenoma causes hypopituitarism through local pressure effects on the pituitary itself. 76% of pituitary tumours in MEN1 are prolactinomas, with the remainder being nonfunctioning adenomas. Prolactinomas are extremely sensitive to medical management with e.g. cabergoline or bromocriptine and even shrink in size subsequently. First line treatment for nonfunctioning adenomas however is surgical removal. The gylcosuria is suggestive of hyperglycaemia, which in the context of this MEN picture suggests a glucagonoma.

The answers try and trick you into looking to manage just one of the abnormalities here in an isolated fashion, e.g. targeting the pituitary with cabergoline, the pancreas with insulin, or the parathyroid with bisphosphonates. This may may happen if you do not recognise that this is MEN. However, as the question asks what treatment is likely to treat the underlying condition, clearly insulin alone, cabergoline alone, or bisphosphonate alone will not suffice. Of the options available, only surgery can tackle all of the problems, and indeed is what most patients with MEN end up needing.

MEN is an autosomal dominant condition. MEN1 consists of tumours of the parathyroid, anterior pituitary, and pancreas:

-  The parathyroid tumours cause hypercalcaemia and its symptoms (which don't forget include polyuria and polydypsia). The management of hypercalcaemia is fluid resuscitation and bisphosphonates.
-  Pituitary tumours can be a prolactinoma, somatotroph adenoma (causing acromegally by secreting growth hormone), or an ACTH-secreting tumour

causing Cushing's disease. There can be any combination of these, although the question will usually point you toward one particular pituitary abnormality. Remember that you are unlikely to elicit a galactorrhoea history unless you specifically ask and are sensitive about it.

-  The pancreas tumours can be an insulinoma (persistent hypoglycaemia -check C-peptide which will be high in endogenous insulin secretion as opposed to exogenously given insulin e.g. in self harm/non-accidental injury, where c-peptide levels remain low. ), gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison, presenting as refractory gastric ulcers), glucagonoma causing persistent hyperglycaemia and also a necrolytic migratory erythema (as in this case), or a VIPoma causing profuse watery diarrhoea (VIP is the antagonist to gastrin and therefore tries to get you to flush the gut out rather than hold and digest contents.

MEN II has two forms. MEN2a presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma (neck lump), parathyroid tumour (hypercalcemia) and pheochromocytoma (hypertension, flushing, tachycardia intermittently). MEN2b presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.

The key message for the exam is that if you are presented with a case where you suspect there is an endocrine abnormality (even just a high calcium), look again at the stem to make sure you are not missing other endocrine abnormalities being present (e.g. amenorrhoea) that might alert you to there being an underlying diagnosis of MEN. If you know a few key features of each of the possible abnormalities within each type of MEN, you should be able to pinpoint which MEN type is present.

## Question #260

A 43-year-old man is referred by his GP with a 4 week history of a lump appearing on the right side of his neck. The lump is roughly 7 mm and is located on the right side of the thyroid gland, in the anterior triangle. It does not move when the patient sticks out his tongue, but it does move on swallowing. There is no history of weight loss of night sweats.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

| Hb         | 12.9 g/l    |
|------------|-------------|
| Platelets  | 210 * 109/l |
| WBC        | 6.0 * 109/l |
| Na+        | 141 mmol/l  |
| K+         | 3.9 mmol/l  |
| Urea       | 4.1 mmol/l  |
| Creatinine | 33 µmol/l   |

What is the most appropriate first-line investigation?

- a) Radioisotope scan of thyroid
- b) Magnetic resonance scan of head and neck
- c) Excision biopsy
- d) Fine needle aspiration biopsy
- e) Ultrasound scan of thyroid

## Answer is E.

High-resolution ultrasound scanning is an ideal first-line initial imaging investigation for most neck lumps. Because most lesions in the neck are sitespecific, once a lesion has been located, specific ultrasound features can be used to establish the diagnosis

## Question #261

A 34 year-old woman is seen by her GP for the annual review of her type 1 diabetes. Her most recent HbA1c is 58 mmol/mol and the only problem she has noticed are severe hypoglycaemic episodes during the night around 2-4am, that she noticed she was getting while working night shifts for a local superstore. However, by breakfast time, her blood glucose levels often rise to around 15 mmol/mol. Her insulin regimen is currently a twice daily mixed insulin.

What is the most appropriate change to her current insulin treatment?

- a. Move to a basal bolus of insulin
- b. Take 1 dextrose tablet at 9pm
- c. Reduce nocturnal insulin dose
- d. Add gliclazide

Answer is A .

This patient is experiencing severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes followed by rises in blood glucose by breakfast time. The most appropriate change to the insulin treatment regimen is changing to a basal bolus regime, with one daily injection of background long-acting insulin and three short acting injections of insulin

## Question #262

A 53-year-old woman is referred to an endocrinology clinic. She has a history of Grave's disease which had previously been controlled on carbimazole however recently presented to her general practitioner due to a two-month history of diarrhoea, palpitations, and heat intolerance. She is post-menopausal and has not had any recent illness or relevant past medical history. The general practitioner performed some thyroid function tests, results of which are as follows:

TSH

0.2

(0.5-5.5 mu/L)

On examination in the clinic, she is warm, tachycardic but otherwise well. A smooth, non-tender goitre is noted however there are no eye signs.

What is the most appropriate treatment?

- a) Advice on medication compliance
- b) Prednisolone
- c) Propylthiouracil
- d) Radioiodine therapy
- e) Thyroidectomy Answer is D.

Radioiodine therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with a relapse of Graves disease in the absence of contraindications, such as pregnancy and active severe Graves ophthalmopathy

Given this woman's medical history, findings of a smooth non-tender goitre, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis here is a relapse of her Grave's disease. In these cases and the absence of any contraindications, radioiodine therapy is the preferred treatment.

Prednisolone can be used in subacute thyroiditis however this is not the diagnosis here as evidenced by the lack of recent illness and non-tender goitre.

Propylthiouracil is an alternative antithyroid drug to carbimazole and is preferred in early pregnancy. As this woman is presenting with a relapse of Grave's disease, radioiodine therapy is preferred. Also, note she is post-menopausal, and therefore pregnancy is not a contraindication here to either radioiodine therapy or carbimazole.

Thyroidectomy is not the first-line treatment in a relapse of previously wellcontrolled Grave's disease.

## Question #263

A 77-year-old female is admitted to the acute medal unit with a chest infection. Her past medical history includes COPD and heart failure. Her current medications include salbutamol, tiotropium, bisoprolol and ramipril. On examination you note left basal crepitations. The JVP is at 2cm above the sternal angle. There is no peripheral oedema. Her blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg.

You note that her blood results are as follows:

| Na+              | 120 mmol/l                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Urine osmolarity | 400 mosmol/l                        |
| Urine sodium     | 50 mosmol/l                         |
| Urea             | 6.2 mmol/l                          |
| Creatinine       | 54 µmol/l                           |
| fT3              | 6.2 pmol/l (normal range 3.5 - 7.8) |
| fT4              | 6 pmol/l (normal range 9.0 - 25.0)  |
| TSH              | 0.2 mU/l (normal range 0.4 - 4.0)   |
| morning cortisol | normal                              |

You water restrict the patient to 1.5 litres per day. On day 4 her bloods are reported as follows:

Na

118 mmol/l



How would you manage this patient?

- a. Furosemide
- b. Levothyroxine
- c. Demeclocycline
- d. Hypertonic saline (3%)
- e. Hypotonic saline (0.45%)

If SIADH is resistant to fluid restriction then the drug demeclocycline can be used

The differential for hyponatraemia is wide. The fluid status of the patient is of paramount importance for identifying the cause. In this example, the patient is clearly euvolaemic. Causes of euvolaemic hyponatraemia include SIADH, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. The serum and urine osmolarities, and urinary sodium are consistent with either of these diagnoses.

SIADH is effectively a diagnosis of exclusion - primary hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism must be excluded to make the diagnosis.

In this case, the thyroid function tests are suggestive of euthyroid sick syndrome. This would not be an indication for initiating levothyroxine. Although hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of hyponatraemia euthyroid sick syndrome would not effect sodium balance. It is often stated that to make a diagnosis of SIADH relies upon 'normal thyroid function tests'. It is important to note that this is referring to primary hypothyroidism. Euthyroid sick syndrome does not preclude the diagnosis of SIADH.

The morning cortisol is normal which suggests that hypoadrenalism is not present.

Therefore the most likely diagnosis is SIADH secondary to a chest infection. The initial treatment for non-severe SIADH is fluid restriction.

This patient has been trialled with fluid restriction however the sodium has not improved and has in fact got worse. The next step in the management would be demeclocycline. Demeclocycline inhibits the effects of ADH on the renal tubules. It effectively causes a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant use of hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline has risks associated with it, as rapid correction of serum Na can result in central pontine myelinolysis.

If the patient had been hypervolaemic then furosemide would be indicated

## Question #264

A middle age woman is being treated for symptomatic hypercalcaemia associated with a squamous cell lung cancer (serum calcium 3.60 mmol/L). She is slow to respond to initial measures of saline hydration and intravenous pamidronate. Whilst awaiting surgical resection for her underlying cancer what may be the next best step in her management?

Na+

142 mmol/l

K+

4.3 mmol/l

Urea

7.0 mmol/l

Creatinine

89 µmol/l

Glucose

4.8 mmol/l

What is the most appropriate management?

- a) High dose loop diuretics
- b) Calcitonin 4 units/kg
- c) Insulin actrapid 50 units in50% dextrose
- d) IV colloid administration instead of crystalloid
- e) Plasma exchange

Answer is B.

General symptoms of hypercalcaemia may include malaise, lethargy, depression, dehydration and can lead to depressed consciousness. Bone pain and abdominal pain may feature and can be summarised by the classic 'bones, stones, moans and abdominal groans'.

Alongside searching for the underlying cause, management initially involves aggressive rehydration, typically 4-6 L saline on the first day. Bisphosphonates act by interfering with osteoclastic bone resorption and typically IV pamidronate is used at a dose of 60-90mg over 2-4 hours. Calcitonin (extracted from salmon) also interferes with osteoclast activity as well as increasing renal calcium excretion.

Diuretics may lead to further dehydration. Dialysis may be a last line treatment for life threatening hypercalacemia, but not plasma exchange

## Question #265

A 23-year-old woman attends a fertility clinic with her partner. She complains of oligomenorrhoea and galactorrhoea and has failed to get pregnant after 18 months of regular unprotected intercourse. Blood tests reveal a serum prolactin level of 6000 mIU/l (normal &lt;500 mIU/l). A pituitary MRI is arranged which shows a microprolactinoma.

Which of the following is the best initial treatment?

- a. Octreotide
- b. Bromocriptine
- c. Trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy
- d. Pituitary radiotherapy
- e. Transfrontal hypophysectomy

Answer is B.

Dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline, bromocriptine) are first-line treatment for prolactinomas, even if there are significant neurological complications

This patient has a prolactinoma. In the majority of cases, symptomatic patients are treated medically with dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) which inhibit the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Surgery is performed for patients who cannot tolerate or fail to respond to medical therapy. A trans-sphenoidal approach is generally preferred unless there is a significant extra-pituitary extension. Radiotherapy is rarely performed and octreotide is a somatostatin analogue used in the treatment of acromegaly.

## Question #266

A 45-year-old man with headaches returns to the endocrinology clinic following investigations. He originally complained of headaches waking him up at night, low energy, weight loss, low libido and postural dizziness. Investigations have revealed a normal full blood count, low free T4, low testosterone, low morning cortisol, low LH and FSH and low TSH. He also had an MRI which is suspicious for pituitary adenoma. He is keen to start whichever is necessary to feel better. He has no other medical problems and takes no regular tablets. Which hormonal replacement would be contra-indicated in the immediate setting?

- a) Hydrocortisone
- b) Prednisolone
- c) Dexamethasone
- d) Testosterone
- e) Levothyroxine

The Answer is E.

In hypothyroidism with adrenal failure do not start thyroid hormone replacement before glucocorticoid replacement as otherwise an adrenal crisis can be precipitated

This patient has panhypopituitarism secondary to a pituitary adenoma. It is critical for patients with adrenal and thyroid insufficiency to replace steroid function prior to replacing thyroid function as otherwise an adrenal crisis can be precipitated. Therefore levothyroxine is contra-indicated in the immediate setting, even though the patient will need replacement after he has started steroid replacement. Typically he would need hydrocortisone split into three doses to replace his steroid needs, and this is preferred over dexamethasone and prednisolone.

Ultimately the treatment may be trans-sphenoidal surgery

## Question #267

A 45-year-old lady is admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and malaise. She has no past medical history and takes no regular medications or supplements. Bloods tests show:



## Chest X-ray - normal appearances

She denies taking any medications or supplements. Her chest X-ray is normal in appearance,and renal function normal. You ring the GP and find out her calcium was also slightly raised 8 years ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a. Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- b. Malignancy with bony metastasis
- c. Primary hyperparathyroidism
- d. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia
- e. Sarcoidosis

Answer is D.

PO4 would normally be low in primary hyperparathyroidism. Her renal function is normal excluding secondary hyperparathyroidism. Sarcoidosis is unlikely with a normal CXR. This leaves malignancy or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. Although malignancy is possible her raised Ca2+ 8 years makes familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia more likely

## Question #268

A 35-year-old woman is known to have a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a. She has tested positive for the RET oncogene and is concerned as her mother had suffered from thyroid cancer. However, she is reluctant to undergo a prophylactic thyroidectomy and asked if there is another option available.

Which of the following management options would be appropriate for her case?

- a) Annual monitoring of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
- b) Annual monitoring of thyroglobulin
- c) Annual 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels (5-HIAA)
- d) Annual monitoring of calcitonin
- e) Annual monitoring of chromogranin A Answer is D.

Calcitonin can be used as a marker to monitor for Medullary thyroid carcinoma in MEN type II in those unwilling to undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy

Calcitonin is a marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma which is associated with MEN type II.

Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA can be used as markers for neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome respectively.

Thyroid peroxidase antibody titre can be used as a marker in autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves disease.

Thyroglobulin can be used as a marker for papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. For example, a rise in this marker following a thyroidectomy can indicate the recurrence of these particular cancers

## Question #269

A 72-year-old male was admitted drowsy and confused. His family describe a 4day history of shortness of breath and a productive cough. His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. He usually takes metformin 500 mg three times daily, gliclazide 80 mg twice daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg nightly. On examination he is confused with dry mucous membranes, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, a pulse of 110/min, a temperature of 37.6 oC and a respiratory rate of 20/min. Course crepitations were found at the right base and his pulse was thready with a capillary refill of 3 seconds; jugular venous pressure was not visible. Capillary blood glucose was found to be HI.

## A venous blood sample is taken:

| Hb         | 129 g/l        | Na +       | 161 mmol/l   |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Platelet s | 204 * 10 9 /l  | K +        | 4.9 mmol/l   |
| WBC        | 13.1 * 10 9 /l | Urea       | 15.2 mmol/l  |
| Neuts      | 11.9 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine | 97 µmol/l    |
| Glucose    | 56 mmol/l      | eGFR       | 62 mg/l      |
| Ketones    | 1.9 mmol/l     | HbA1c      | 75 mmol/mol  |
| pH         | 7.35           | HCO3       | 20 mmol/mol  |

What treatment would you initiate first?

- a. 0.9% normal saline
- b. 0.45 % normal saline
- c. Hartmann's solution
- d. Intravenous insulin
- e. 5% dextrose

## Answer is A.

The underlying diagnosis is hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) precipitated by a lower respiratory tract infection. The diagnosis is made when a patient shows marked hyperglycaemia and hypovolaemia with a serum osmolality &gt; 320 mosm/kg in the absence of marked ketonaemia or acidosis. This patient is clinically dry with a glucose of 56 and a calculated osmolality of 2(161+4.9) + 56 + 15 = 403 mosm/kg with mild ketonaemia.

Despite this gentlemen's hypernatraemia, the first line fluid therapy is 0.9% normal saline as patients in HHS are sodium deplete. One litre should be administered rapidly and electrolytes then repeated to gauge potassium requirements in further fluid bags. A small initial rise in sodium is expected and this should not discourage further use of normal saline. Insulin is not routinely started immediately in the absence of significant ketonaemia as glucose will fall with fluid therapy alone. When glucose stops falling insulin may be started if glucose still remains high. Too rapid correction of osmolality i.e. with aggressive insulin and fluids in combination can precipitate cerebral oedema.

## Question #270

An 18-year-old man presents to the clinic with poor development of secondary sexual characteristics. On examination, you note a lack of testicle development and sparse axillary and pubic hair.

## Blood results are as follows:

| Testosteron e   | 2 nmol/L   | (6 -27)      |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| FSH             | 4.6 IU/L   | (1.8 - 22.5) |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Androgen insensitivity syndrome
- b) Kallmann's syndrome
- c) Klinefelter syndrome
- d) Mullerian agenesis
- e) Turner's syndrome

Kallman's syndrome - LH &amp; FSH low-normal and testosterone is low

Kallmann's syndrome is correct. Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The biochemical profile is in keeping with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to the presence of low testosterone and inappropriately normal LH and FSH. Kallmann's syndrome is the only listed condition which results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is correct. Androgen insensitivity syndrome in its complete form is a disorder of hormone resistance characterised by a female phenotype in a genetic male due to the resistance to the effector functions of testosterone. The hormonal profile findings include very high testosterone, elevated LH, and a relatively normal FSH. Thus the patient's phenotypical sex and hormonal profile exclude this diagnosis.

Klinefelter syndrome is incorrect. Klinefelter syndrome is an aneuploid genetic condition where a male has an additional copy of the X chromosome. The primary features are infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles. This condition results in primary gonadal failure, and thus a compensatory elevation in LH and FSH.

Mullerian agenesis is incorrect. Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterised by a failure of the Mullerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Given that the patient is phenotypically male, this diagnosis is unlikely.

Turner's syndrome is incorrect. Turner's syndrome can cause primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis. This would present with low sex hormone levels, and markedly raised LH and FSH levels. It only affects females. Thus the patient's phenotypic sex, and biochemical results are not in keeping with this diagnosis.

## Question #271

A 17-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology outpatient clinic with primary amenorrhoea. She has no past medical history and does not take any medications.

On examination, there is no axillary or pubic hair. There are swellings palpable in the groins bilaterally. There is normal breast development.



What is the likely diagnosis?

- a. 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency
- b. Androgen insensitivity syndrome
- c. Klinefelter syndrome
- d. Pituitary tumour
- e. Turner syndrome

Primary amenorrhoea, little or no axillary and pubic hair, elevated testosterone → androgen insensitivity syndrome

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the correct answer. This is an X-linked recessive condition caused by end-organ resistance to testosterone causing genotypically male children (46XY) to have a female phenotype. Patients often present with primary amenorrhoea along with absent pubic/axillary hair. Bilateral groin swellings may reflect undescended testes and breast development may occur as a result of the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol. Testosterone is typically in the upper normal range for a post-pubertal male.

17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is incorrect. This is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that may also present with primary amenorrhoea and external female genitalia. However, in this condition, testosterone will be low as a lack of androgens are characteristic of this disease.

Klinefelter syndrome is incorrect. This is a syndrome where a patient that is phenotypically male has an extra X chromosome (i.e. 47 XXY). Patients may have small testicles and infertility as predominant features. The patient in this scenario is phenotypically female.

Pituitary tumour is incorrect. This may cause delayed puberty if it causes impaired secretion of gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) i.e. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, breast development may also be impaired with a pituitary tumour and testosterone will be in the normal range for a female, in contrast to this case where it is in the high-normal range for a male.

Turner syndrome is incorrect. This can cause primary amenorrhoea as a consequence of primary ovarian insufficiency. Breast development will be abnormal but pubic and axillary hair development will typically be normal. Unlike this case, testosterone will be in the normal range for a female. Patients have a 45XO karyotype

## Question #272

A patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus is referred urgently from a Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) course, a course designed to help patients with type 1 diabetes correctly assess carbohydrate contents, to the endocrinology consultant. The nurse in the course was concerned because she found that the patient has had three episodes of hypoglycaemia within the last nine months where he required aid from his wife in order to increase his blood glucose levels. He takes a basal bolus regime of long acting insulin once a night as well as short acting insulin three times a day. He works in a restaurant. He is an ex-smoker who drinks very little alcohol. Apart from adjusting the insulin dose, what is the most appropriate action?

- a) Advise the patient to inform the DVLA and to not drive
- b) The consultant should inform the DVLA
- c) Advise the patient to start checking blood glucose prior to driving
- d) Advise the patient to always carry a snack when driving
- e) Advise the patient to attend retinal screening prior to driving again

Patient with diabetes who have had two hypoglycaemic episodes requiring help needs to surrender their driving licence

This patient has had hypoglycaemic episodes needing help multiple times. If a patient needs help to correct the hypoglycaemic episode then it is termed severe hypoglycaemia and is of concern to the DVLA. If a patient has two or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia then they need to inform the DVLA and not drive.

Patients who take insulin should have their licence for driving assessed on an annual basis. For this they will be required to submit three months of blood glucose readings. Patients are advised to always check blood glucose before driving and to always have a snack in their vehicle as well, not just if having hypoglycaemic episodes.

When the DVLA is informed, the patient should be advised to inform the DVLA themselves rather than breaking patient confidentiality, but if the patient repeatedly fails to follow this advise then the doctor should inform the DVLA after telling the patient that he or she is doing so

## Question #273

A 37-year-old man presents to the endocrinology clinic for review. He was started on hydrocortisone for Addison's disease six months ago following a history of feeling generally unwell, postural dizziness and vomiting. Following starting hydrocortisone he felt much better. He was originally started on 10mg in the morning and 5mg at lunchtime and 5mg in the early afternoon. This was further increased to 10mg, 10mg and 5mg for the morning, lunchtime, and afternoon, respectively. The patient feels that all of the original symptoms have resolved, but he has noticed swelling of his ankles. On examination, he has non-pitting oedema of his legs. He has a heart rate of 78bpm, blood pressure of 165/102mmHg, saturations of 98% on room air and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His previous blood pressure recorded in clinic had been 105/61mmHg He has no other medical problems, and takes no other tablets apart from paracetamol and ibuprofen when needed, especially for headaches. What is the most appropriate action?

- a. Start amlodipine
- b. Start ACE inhibitor
- c. Reduce dose of hydrocortisone
- d. Increase dose of hydrocortisone
- e. Start beta-blocker

Correct answer is c

Features of over-replacement of corticosteroids require dose adjustment

This is a patient on treatment for Addison's disease who has developed evidence of over-replacement. These features can be any of Cushing's disease; such as hypertension for this patient. The increase in blood pressure with steroids implies that this is not essential hypertension but rather secondary hypertension. This implies that he is having a too much steroid replacement and hydrocortisone dose should be reduced. Features of over-replacement include hypertension, thin skin, striae, easy bruising, hyperglycaemia and electrolyte abnormalities. Features of under-replacement include fatigue, postural hypotension, weight loss and salt craving

A 28-year-old woman has presented with a 5 month history of weight loss (despite an increase in appetite), tremor, loose bowels, and heat intolerance. She has otherwise been well and her only significant family history is that her brother has alopecia areata. She tells you that she had a positive pregnancy test last week and is awaiting her booking appointment. On examination, she appears anxious and her heart rate is 105 beats/minute. She has a tremor when her arms are outstretched and her eyes appear large. She also has a goitre. The rest of her examination is unremarkable. Her blood results find hyperthyroidism. Which of the following medications are most suited to treat her hyperthyroidism?

- a) Propylthiouracil
- b) Carbimazole
- c) Radioactive iodine
- d) Carbimazole and Levothyroxine
- e) Levothyroxine answer is A

During early pregnancy, propylthiouracil should be used. The block and replace strategy is not advised as it can lead to problems in the fetus and radioactive iodine is contraindicated. Please see the link below for more information: https:www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/6-endocrine-system/62thyroid-and-antithyroid-drugs/622-antithyroid-drugs

## Question #275

A 50-year-old woman is reviewed in your follow-up endocrinology clinic. She was referred one year ago by her GP, having noticed a nodule in the front of her neck. Before noticing this nodule, she had suffered from a 6-month history of worsening diarrhoea, and occasional flushing. She was found to have a mutation of the RET proto-oncogene and underwent a thyroidectomy, followed by external beam radiotherapy. Her only current medication is levothyroxine.

Which of the following is the most useful test in monitoring for recurrence of this woman's disease?

- a. Alfa fetoprotein
- b. Calcitonin
- c. Thyroglobulin
- d. Thyroid stimulating hormone
- e. Thyroxine

## Answer is B

Medullary thyroid cancer - calcitonin is used for screening, prognosis and monitoring

Medullary thyroid carcinoma originates from the C cells, or parafollicular cells, which secrete calcitonin. It makes up approximately 5% of thyroid cancers. It may be sporadic, but in 25% of cases, it is associated with RET oncogene, as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Despite testing positive for RET oncogene it is possible that other features of MEN2, such as hyperparathyroidism or phaeochromocytoma, do not manifest. Such is the case with this woman.

Also, note that radioiodine was not used in the treatment of her disease. Unlike other thyroid cancers, it is of little benefit in medullary thyroid cancer. Her symptoms of flushing and diarrhoea, are typical of medullary cancer and are caused by calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Papillary and follicular cancers are more commonly asymptomatic.

Calcitonin is used for screening, prognosis and monitoring in medullary thyroid cancer. CEA is often used in conjunction with calcitonin but is not an option here.

Thyroglobulin is used in monitoring follicular thyroid cancer.

Thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are both typically normal in thyroid cancer. This woman has had her thyroid gland removed, and is taking levothyroxine. As such, she would likely be having her TSH monitored. Unlike in other thyroid cancers, TSH suppression is not appropriate for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer and so thyroxine replacement is monitored similarly to that of hypothyroidism, with a target TSH within the normal range. Her TSH may be monitored, but not to detect recurrence of medullary thyroid cancer.

Alfa fetoprotein is not of use in monitoring thyroid cancer.

## Question #276

A 28-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology department with abnormal thyroid function tests and neck pain. She has a past medical history of bipolar affecting disorder and takes lithium. She smokes five cigarettes daily. She is unemployed. She gave birth to her first child six weeks ago and has recently recovered from a coryzal illness. She is not breastfeeding.

On examination, there is a tender swelling in her neck. She is sweaty, mildly tremulous and tachycardia (heart rate 104 beats per minute). Examination of her eyes is unremarkable.

A radioactive iodine uptake scan reveals globally reduced uptake of iodine-131.

What is the likely diagnosis?

- a) De Quervain's thyroiditis
- b) Factitious hyperthyroidism
- c) Grave's disease
- d) Lithium associated thyroiditis
- e) Post-partum thyroiditis

Answer is A

De Quervain's thyroiditis: initial hyperthyroidism, painful goitre and globally reduced uptake of iodine-131

De Quervain's thyroiditis is the correct answer. This woman presents with painful swelling in her neck (a likely goitre in the context of hyperthyroidism) post-coryzal illness with raised inflammatory markers (CRP), in association with globally reduced uptake of iodine-131. These findings are consistent with viral sub-acute thyroiditis.

Factitious hyperthyroidism is incorrect. Although she has a history of depression (and this is a risk factor for thyroid hormone misuse), this would not explain the raised CRP or neck pain.

Grave's disease is incorrect. This is associated with increased uptake of iodine-131 on a radioactive iodine scan.

Lithium associated thyroiditis is incorrect. This is classically 'painless' thyroiditis.

Post-partum thyroiditis is incorrect. While she is post-partum and this is a plausible differential, this condition is not associated with neck pain or raised inflammatory markers, making this diagnosis unlikely.

## Question #277

A 17-year-old girl is brought into the emergency department by her mother. The patient appears terrified after she experienced an episode on waking earlier in the morning when she could not move at all for 2 hours. This was her second episode. She reports no loss of consciousness and was aware throughout the episode. She has no other past medical history documented. She is not aware of a previous episode of epilepsy. On examination, her heart sounds and breath sounds are unremarkable. Neurological examination demonstrated no abnormalities. She has normal dentition and her body mass index is 19.5 kg/m². A 12 lead ECG demonstrated a jerky baseline with flat T waves. What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a. Partial or absence seizures
- b. Guillain-Barre syndrome
- c. Botulinum toxicity
- d. Myasthenia gravis
- e. Hypokalaemia

## Answer is E

The patient describes episodes of periodic paralysis and the ECG characteristics are consistent with that of hypokalaemia. The underlying diagnosis is a rare familial condition of skeletal muscle ion channels called hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, which tends to develop in childhood and adolescence. Attacks last hours and the neurological examination is usually unremarkable in between attacks. The average potassium on diagnosis is 2.4 mmol/L1. Diagnosis is often made clinically in association with low potassium but genetic testing can help if known mutations are present.

## Question #278

A 66-year-old man is referred to the endocrinology outpatient department with resistant hypertension and hypokalaemia. He is asymptomatic. He is on regular ramipril, amlodipine, indapamide and doxazosin. He has a further past medical history of hypercholesterolaemia. He has smoked five cigarettes daily for thirty years and drinks 2-3 bottles of wine per week. He is a non-executive director of a large multinational company.

His observations are heart rate 76 beats per minute, blood pressure 181/88 mmHg, respiratory rate 12/minute, oxygen saturations 97% on room air. He is apyrexial and appears clinically well. An examination is unremarkable other than a raised body mass index of 35.2 kg/m².

A CT of the abdomen demonstrates bilateral adrenal enlargement and adrenal vein sampling demonstrates the production of excess aldosterone bilaterally.

What is the most appropriate treatment?

- a) Chemotherapy
- b) IV hydrocortisone
- c) Radiotherapy
- d) Spironolactone
- e) Surgery

Answer is D

Primary hyperaldosteronism: manage with spironolactone

Important for me  Less important

Spironolactone is the correct answer. Primary hyperaldosteronism caused by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is treated by a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone.

Chemotherapy is the wrong answer. The first-line treatment for bilateral adrenal hyperplasia causing primary hyperaldosteronism is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone. If a patient had disseminated malignancy caused by an adrenal carcinoma, then this may be an option.

IV hydrocortisone is incorrect. This is the treatment for acute hypoadrenalism i.e. an Addisonian crisis. The patient's cortisol is within normal limits and he has no clinical features of hypoadrenalism.

Radiotherapy is incorrect. This type of treatment may be indicated for adrenal carcinoma. However, cancer is more likely to be a unilateral mass-like lesion, rather than bilateral diffuse enlargement.

Surgery is incorrect. This would be the correct option if the patient had a unilateral adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone. This is not the case here.

## Question #279

A 29-year-old woman is referred to the Endocrinology clinic as she has just found out she is pregnant. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism three years ago and is currently stable on a dose of levothyroxine 75mcg od. She has also been taking folic acid 400mcg od for the past 6 months. Her last bloods taken 6 months ago show the following:



You request a repeat TSH and free T4 measurement. What is the most appropriate next step?

- a. Decrease levothyroxine to 50mcg od
- b. Keep levothyroxine at 75mcg od
- c. Increase levothyroxine to 100mcg od
- d. Keep levothyroxine at 75mcg od + increase folic acid to 5mg od
- e. Stop levothyroxine until TSH known

Answer is C

Pregnant with hypothyroidism → immediately increase levothyroxine and monitor TSH closely

The correct answer is to increase levothyroxine to 100mcg od . In pregnant women with hypothyroidism, it is essential to maintain adequate thyroid hormone levels for the developing fetus. The requirement for levothyroxine often increases during pregnancy due to increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and placental degradation of maternal T4. According to UK guidelines, pregnant women with pre-existing hypothyroidism should have their levothyroxine dose increased by approximately 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, even before obtaining repeat TSH and free T4 measurements. This ensures that both mother and baby have sufficient thyroid hormone levels during the critical early stages of fetal development.

The option to decrease levothyroxine to 50mcg od would not be appropriate, as reducing the dose could lead to inadequate thyroid hormone levels in the mother and potentially harm fetal development.

Keeping the levothyroxine at 75mcg od might seem reasonable if her TSH was well-controlled prior to pregnancy; however, this does not account for the increased requirements during pregnancy. It would be safer and more appropriate to increase the dose proactively.

As for keeping levothyroxine at 75mcg od + increasing folic acid to 5mg od , while it is important for pregnant women to take folic acid supplements, increasing the dose of folic acid alone without adjusting the levothyroxine dosage does not address her increased thyroid hormone needs during pregnancy.

Finally, choosing to stop levothyroxine until TSH is known would put both mother and fetus at risk of complications related to untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism. It is crucial that patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism continue their levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy, with appropriate dose adjustments as needed.

Question #280

A 25-year-old female presents with galactorrhoea. She reports no other symptoms on systematic enquiry. She has no past medical history and takes no regular medicines.

## Blood results are as follows:

| FSH        | 0.2 mIU/ml (normal 1 - 8)   | LH           | 0.5 mIU/ml (normal 1-18)   |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Oestradiol | 482 pg/ml (normal 27 - 123) | Progesterone | 46 ng/mL (normal 5 - 20)   |
| Prolactin  | 82 ng/dL (normal 5 - 40)    |              |                            |

## What investigation will you perform?

- a) MRI pituitary
- b) Thyroid function tests
- c) Pregnancy test
- d) Pelvic ultrasound
- e) No further investigations Answer is C

Pregnancy is an important differential to consider when assessing a female patient with hyperprolactinaemia

The hormone results are entirely consistent with pregnancy. Oestradiol and progesterone are secreted from the corpus luteum in early pregnancy. At approximately the third month of gestation, the placenta takes over as the source of oestrogen and progesterone. High levels of these hormones results in suppression of LH and FSH. During pregnancy, prolactin levels also increase. Prolactin causes enlargement of the mammary glands and prepares for milk production.

## Question #281

You are asked to review a 43-year-old man in theatre recovery who has developed a fever and tachycardia post-operatively. He is previously fit and well, does not smoke and drinks alcohol only occasionally. He had fallen the previous night and suffered a distal radius fracture and has just undergone a open reduction and internal fixation under general anaesthetic. During anaesthesia he received 4mg ondansetron and 8mg dexamethasone for post-operative nausea and 10mg morphine for pain. He denies feeling unwell and has no symptoms suggestive of intercurrent infection.

On examination his heart rate is 130 beats/min and irregular, his blood pressure is 135/74 mmHg and his temperature is 39.4ºC. His chest is clear to auscultation, his abdomen soft and non-tender and there is no rash or meningism. His right forearm is in plaster, but is not particularly painful and his fingers are warm and have normal sensation.

| Creatinine                  | 95 µmol/l      |
| C-reactive protein          | 1 mg/L         |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone | <0.02 mIU/L    |
| Cortisol                    | 45 µg/dL       |

What is the most appropriate initial treatment?

- a. Carbimazole
- b. Hydrocortisone
- c. Propranolol
- d. Broad spectrum antibiotics
- e. Crystalloid infusion
6. answer is C

The diagnosis here is thyrotoxicosis as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism. Infection is unlikely given the normal clinical examination and normal CRP. During initial treatment of thyrotoxicosis it is important to treat hypoadrenalism first - if present - in order to not precipitate a addisonian crisis. However, this patient has no features in the history to suggest pre-existing Addisons disease, he has normal electrolytes and the suppressed cortisol can be explained by the peri-operative use of dexamethasone. Initial treatment of thyrotoxicosis should focus on sympathetic storm suppression using beta blockade. Anti-thyroid medications i.e. carbimazole - take up to six weeks to take full effect and are not useful in the acute scenario.

## Question #282

A 29-year-old woman is referred by her GP to the outpatient department with increasing symptoms of heat intolerance, diarrhoea and anxiety over the past couple of weeks. The patient is 34 weeks pregnant with her first baby and has a past medical history of hyperthyroidism, currently being treated with 10mg carbimazole. She has no other past medical history of note and her mother also had hyperthyroidism. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and does not take any recreational drugs.

On examination, her pulse is 98 beats per minute, blood pressure is 124/82 mmHg and her respiratory rate is 14/min. Her oxygen saturation is 98% and temperature is 37.5ºC.

## Blood tests are performed and reveal:

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)

0.04 mu/l

Free thyroxine (T4)

21 pmol/l

Total thyroxine (T4)

152 nmol/l

What is the most appropriate management?

- a) Refer patient for immediate caesarean section
- b) Increase carbimazole dose to 20mg once daily
- c) Commence radioiodine treatment
- d) Switch carbimazole to propylthiouracil
- e) Refer for a thyroidectomy

## Answer is B

The carbimazole can be increased to up to 20mg once daily during pregnancy. Propylthiouracil can be started instead of the carbimazole if the increased carbimazole dose does not adequately control the patients hyperthyroidism.

## Question #283

A 53-year-old obese HGV driver, normally taking BD Novomix 30 insulin presents to your outpatient clinic to clarify some driving regulations he had overheard while eating with colleagues. He is extremely tearful and anxious. He is worried about losing his livelihood as a result of his diabetes.

He was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 9 years ago and became insulin dependent 2 years ago. He reports good compliance with insulin every day. However, 18 months ago, he took the same units of insulin after exercising and felt giddy. A spot blood glucose check demonstrated 2.8 mmol/l, which improved immediately after drinking Lucozade that he carried with him. No hospitalisation was required. He has no other past medical history. He has no visual field or peripheral nerve impairments. What is the advice you give him regarding driving?

- a. Can continue driving, review in 1 year
- b. Can continue driving, no further reviews required
- c. Must stop driving and give up license permanently
- d. Must stop driving temporarily and review in 6 months
- e. Patient can drive type 1 vehicles (cars, motorcycles) but not type 2 vehicles (lorries, HGV) and should reconsider his profession

## Answer is A

The salient points in this case history are that the patient, although insulin dependent for treating his type 2 diabetes, retains hypoglycaemia awareness. A recent change in the DVLA guidelines of May 2012 allows HGV drivers to retain their license even if taking insulin, provided they have not suffered from hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of others within the past 12 months, and the patient has no visual field impairments. The patient must then be reviewed annually by a diabetes consultant, with 3 months of blood glucose monitoring data available. A 1-year license is then issued annually.

## Question #284

A 59-year-old man comes to the GP surgery due to facial changes over the last 6months. He has a history of hypertension which remains uncontrolled despite compliance with medications, a low-salt diet, and regular exercise.

His observations are taken as follows: temperature is 36.7ºC, blood pressure 146/98mmHg, heart rate 90/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. On examination, facial features appear coarse and differ significantly from those on his driver's license photograph taken 3 years ago. His fingers are swollen, and his skin appears to have thickened.

His IGF-1 levels are raised, and an MRI shows a pituitary adenoma. The patient undergoes trans-sphenoidal surgery for the resection of his tumour.

On follow-up 3 months later, his serum IGF-1 levels are still raised. He still has the same symptoms as before. He is referred for a repeat MRI that shows no residual tumour.

Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?

- a) Refer for stereotactic radiotherapy
- b) Repeat transsphenoidal surger
- c) Start octreotide
- d) Repeat IGF-1 levels in 12 weeks
- e) Repeat IGF-1 levels in six months

## Answer is C

Acromegaly: if patients are not suitable for trans-sphenoidal surgery, or have residual symptoms, then octreotide may be used

This patient's facial changes over time, coarse facial features on examination and elevated IGF-1 levels point towards a diagnosis of acromegaly. Since his MRI showed a pituitary adenoma, he was treated with transsphenoidal surgery. However, he remains symptomatic, and his IGF-1 levels have not reduced even after 3 months. Patients with residual symptoms need to repeat transsphenoidal surgery or start medical therapy with octreotide.

Since this patient has no residual tumour on his repeat MRI, he is not a candidate for repeat transsphenoidal surgery. Therefore, the most appropriate step for this patient is to start medical therapy with octreotide. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. It tends to decrease the size of the adenoma and its secretion of growth hormone.

Stereotactic radiotherapy is recommended for patients who fail medical therapy and is therefore not the best next step in the management of this patient.

Repeating IGF-1 levels again in 12 weeks is inappropriate as the IGF-1 level should have normalised at this follow-up 12 weeks after the transsphenoidal surgery. His repeat IGF-1 levels at 12 weeks are raised. He requires further medical or surgical management instead of follow-up in 12 weeks.

Patients with normal IGF-1 levels on a 12-week follow-up should have repeat IGF-1 levels at six months and then, annually.

## Question #285

A 64-year-old man presents with confusion. A systematic enquiry was otherwise unremarkable. He has a history of bipolar disorder for which he takes lithium. He does not take any other regular medications. He drinks approximately 6 pints of beer per day. He is euvolemic on examination.

## Blood results are as follows:

| Na +                              | 125 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +                               | 3.6 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea                              | 6.2 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine                        | 72 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) | 4.8 mU/L     | (0.5-5.5)     |
| Free thyroxine (T4)               | 14.2 pmol/L  | (9.0 - 18)    |
| Early morning cortisol            | 440 nmol/l   | (>350)        |

## Osmolarity studies are requested:

| Urine osmolarity   | 320 mmol/L    | (300-900)   |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Urine sodium       | 54 mmol/L     | (>40)       |
| Plasma osmolarity  | 261.5 mOsm/kg | (275 - 295) |

What is the most likely explanation?

- a. Beer potomania
- b. Cerebral salt wasting
- c. Diabetes insipidus
- d. Primary polydipsia
- e. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH)

SIADH criteria includes Na &lt; 135, serum osmolality &lt;271 and urinary osmolality &gt;100 in a euvolaemic patient

The patient has significant hyponatraemia. Since the serum osmolarity is &lt; 275 we have confirmed a true hypotonic state.

In contrast, if the serum osmolarity was normal (275-295) then this would imply isotonic hyponatremia (i.e. pseudohyponatraemia). This is a measuring defect which can occur due to high levels of lipids (e.g. triglycerides) or proteins (e.g. macroglobulinaemia). These macromolecules take up a proportion of plasma volume thereby resulting in a spurious hyponatremia (as the lab measures Na / plasma volume rather than Na / plasma fluid).

If the serum osmolarity is &gt; 295 then this implies a hypertonic hyponatremia. This occurs due to high levels of osmotically active solutes (e.g. hyperglycaemia or mannitol). This results in an osmotic shift of fluid into the extracellular space resulting in dilutional hyponatremia.

In this clinical case, we are dealing with a true hypotonic hyponatremia. The causes of this are wide but can broadly be divided into:

-  Too much fluid (e.g. decreased output or increased intake)
-  Too little sodium (e.g. decreased intake or increased output)
-  Can also be due to a combination e.g. sodium and water loss (with sodium loss &gt; water loss)

It is therefore absolutely essential to assess the fluid status of the patient to help identify the cause.

Urinary sodium is an exceptionally useful tool, and indeed after clinical examination, this is the most useful investigation. In hyponatremia, we would expect low urinary sodium as a physiological response to conserve sodium. Therefore urinary sodium &gt;10 is suggestive of renal sodium loss (e.g. CKD, diuretics, hypoaldosteronism, and salt-losing nephropathy). Other causes of high urinary sodium include endocrine disease (e.g. Addison's), primary polydipsia, and SIADH. In SIADH, an initial hypervolaemic state results in aldosterone suppression resulting in natriuresis and high urinary sodium. In secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. heart failure, nephrotic syndrome) we get increased sodium retention and therefore low urinary sodium.

It is extremely important to note that urine osmolarities and electrolytes must be interpreted with caution. Urinary sodium will be high after taking diuretics, but may go very low after their effects wear off, particularly if the patient is dehydrated.

The urine osmolarity is often not particularly helpful. In the presence of hyponatremia, the body's natural response to raise sodium would be to increase free water output resulting in a high urinary output with low urine osmolarity. Therefore urine osmolarity helps to differentiate between conditions associated with impaired free water excretion (high urine osmolarity &gt;100), as seen in the majority of cases, and a few conditions associated with low urine osmolarity &lt;100.

The urine osmolarity will be raised (&gt;100) in the majority of cases either due to inappropriate ADH release (e.g. SIADH), appropriate ADH release (hypovolaemia) or pseudo 'appropriate' ADH release (perceived intravascular depletion but actual hypervolaemic states e.g. nephrotic syndrome, heart failure and cirrhosis). However, if it is low (&lt;100) then this suggests psychogenic polydipsia or beer drinker's protomania.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH release (SIADH) is correct. The patient fulfils the diagnostic criteria of SIADH making this the most likely diagnosis. Importantly he fulfils the biochemical criteria, has normal thyroid and adrenal function, is euvolemic, and is not on diuretics which may confound the biochemical analysis.

Beer potomania is incorrect. Potomania is a specific hypo-osmolality syndrome related to the massive consumption of beer, which is poor in solutes and electrolytes. In this condition, one would expect the urine osmolarity to be &lt;100 since free water excretion is not impaired in this condition.

Cerebral salt wasting is incorrect. Both cerebral salt wasting and SIADH are characterised by hyponatremia with elevated urinary sodium and concentrated urine. The key distinguishing factor is that in cerebral salt wasting the patient is hypovolemic whereas SIADH patients are euvolaemic.

Diabetes insipidus is incorrect. The fact that the patient is on lithium is a red herring. Lithium is a well-known cause of diabetes insipidus (DI), however, DI is essentially the opposite condition to SIADH. In DI we have a failure of ADH to act on the kidneys resulting in polyuria, dehydration, raised serum osmolarity and hypernatraemia,

Primary polydipsia is incorrect. In this condition, one would expect the urine osmolarity to be &lt;100 since free water excretion is not impaired.

## Question #286

A 25-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after being found unwell by friends. Collateral history reported by the paramedics indicated that the patient had been unwell for 3 days with vomiting and diarrhoea. Her housemate said that the patient had been unable to eat since becoming unwell and that he did not think she had been taking her regular insulin during that time. The patient herself was too disorientated to give any history. The paramedics had found both novorapid and lantus insulin pen devices in the patients fridge.

General examination indicated a drowsy and dehydrated patient with generalised abdominal tenderness but no evidence of focal peritonism.

Please see below for selected investigation results.

What is the appropriate strategy for intravenous insulin treatment in this patient?

- a) Variable rate insulin infusion without initial insulin bolus, converting to subcutaneous insulin once acidosis resolved
- b) Fixed rate insulin infusion without initial insulin bolus, converting to subcutaneous insulin once patient is eating and drinking normall
- c) Fixed rate insulin infusion following initial insulin bolus, converting to subcutaneous insulin once patient is eating and drinking normally
- d) Variable rate insulin infusion with initial insulin bolus, converting to subcutaneous insulin once acidosis resolved
- e) Variable rate insulin infusion without initial insulin bolus, converting to subcutaneous insulin once ketonaemia resolved

## Answer is B

The patient is presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis due to vomiting, dehydration and omission of prescribed insulin.

The Joint British Diabetes Society recommend an insulin infusion at rate 0.1 units / kg / h. An initial bolus of insulin is not advised due to a randomised controlled trial that found no benefit. Fixed rate insulin infusions are now preferred over titration of insulin dose against blood sugar levels (sliding scale). This is due to the fact that blood glucose may correct more quickly than ketoacidosis and so ensures adequate insulin to eradicate ketones.

There is no consensus between expert bodies as to biochemical end-point of DKA, therefore it is advised that patients are transferred onto subcutaneous insulin once they are eating and drinking normally. It is vital to ensure an overlap between the administration of intravenous and subcutaneous insulin to avoid recurrent ketogenesis.

## Question #287

A 24-year-old woman presents to hospital after collapsing while out shopping. On taking her observations, she has a temperature 37.2°C, a pulse rate of 78 per minute which is regular and normal in character and a blood pressure of 164/92 mmHg. Heart sounds 1 and 2 were present with no added sounds and his chest was clear on auscultation. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender with no organomegaly. Neurological examination was unremarkable. She has no past medical history of note and is on no regular medications.

Further blood tests reveal low renin and aldosterone levels, hypokalaemia and a serum bicarbonate of 30 mmol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for her condition?

- a. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy
- b. Bumetanide
- c. Potassium replacement
- d. Spironolactone
- e. Amiloride

## Answer is E

This woman has presented with the combination of hypokalaemic alkalosis, suppressed renin and aldosterone levels in the presence of hypertension indicates a diagnosis of Liddle syndrome. Hypertension and hypokalaemia respond well to amiloride. Spironolactone is not as effective as this medication acts on the mineralocorticoid receptor, as opposed to amiloride, which acts directly on the sodium channel.

## Question #289

A 69-year-old woman presents to the general practitioner. She reports that when she gets dressed she has noticed that she has been involuntarily leaking urine throughout the day however she denies any episodes of sudden urgency.

Otherwise, she is fit and well and performs her activities of daily living independently.

What is the most appropriate first-line management?

- a) Bladder retraining
- b) Mirabegron
- c) Oxybutynin
- d) Pelvic floor muscle training
- e) Tamsulosin

answer is D.

Urinary incontinence - first-line treatment:

-  urge incontinence: bladder retraining
-  stress incontinence: pelvic floor muscle training

This woman is presenting with stress incontinence, a leaking of urine normally triggered by coughing, laughing, or sneezing. Although often associated with pelvic floor damage for example during childbirth, it can also present as a result of age-related changes. The first-line management for stress incontinence is pelvic floor muscle training which is the correct answer here.

Bladder retraining is useful in cases of urge incontinence however this patient denies any history of urinary urgency. Urge incontinence occurs due to an overactive bladder. Bladder retraining aims to regain control over the function of the bladder. As stress incontinence is related to weakened pelvic floor muscles, bladder retraining would not be as effective as pelvic floor muscle training in this case.

Mirabegron is a beta-3 agonist that relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder, increasing bladder capacity. As the primary problem with stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, mirabegron would not be the first-line treatment in this case.

Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic that is also prescribed for an overactive bladder. Again, this relaxes the detrusor muscles but as the primary pathology in stress incontinence is related to the pelvic floor muscles, this would not be the first-line management step here.

Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 antagonist which relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and urethra. This is useful in the treatment of overflow incontinence as a result of urethral obstruction for example from benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has no effect on the pelvic floor muscles which are weakened in stress incontinence and so has no role here.

## Question #290

A 73-year-old woman presents to the general medical clinic. She has been investigated for hyponatraemia and has come for discussion of her results. She was incidentally found to have low sodium after having blood tests during a community-acquired chest infection two weeks ago. The chest infection has entirely resolved. She was found to have radiological evidence of small cell lung cancer on CT scan of her chest during investigations for her chest infection as well. She declined further biopsy or any investigation for this finding. Clinically she is euvolaemic. She has had serum sodium and osmolality measured. She is suspected of having SIADH.

Na+

122 mmol/l

K+

4.1 mmol/l

Urea

4.8 mmol/l

Creatinine

69 µmol/l

Serum osmolality

240 mmol/kg

What further investigation would be necessary to diagnose SIADH?

- a. Random serum cortisol
- b. Echocardiogram
- c. Lung biopsy
- d. Urinary electrolytes and osmolality
- e. Water deprivation test

Answer is D.

SIADH criteria includes Na &lt; 135, serum osmolality &lt;271 and urinary osmolality &gt;100 in a euvolaemic patient

This patient has established hyponatraemia with low serum osmolality. She needs to have elevated urinary osmolality to confirm the diagnosis of SIADH in the context of hyponatraemia and no other cause such as hypervolaemia. A morning cortisol would be helpful in diagnosing Addison's disease, and if suspected would be a useful investigation, but a random serum cortisol would not be very helpful. An echocardiogram could exclude heart failure in the context of fluid overload as a cause of hyponatraemia, but in the absence of peripheral oedema, a raised JVP and pulmonary oedema this is unlikely to be necessary. Water deprivation test is done to confirm diabetes insipidus

## Question #291

A 24 year-old man presents with a five week history of increasing thirst and frequency of urinating. The GP suspects diabetes and performs two fasting blood tests on separate days which reveal blood glucose results of 8.7 mmol/l and 9.2 mmol/l. Urinalysis does not detect any ketones or protein in the urine. The patient's mother had a diagnosis as type 1 diabetes at the age of 22 and his maternal grandfather and aunt also have type 1 diabetes. Due to the family history, the patient's c-peptide is measured and found to be consistently high on two occasions.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate first treatment for managing this condition?

- a) Gliclazide
- b) Metformin
- c) Pioglitazone
- d) Insulin
- e) Sitagliptin

Answer is A.

The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is maturity onset diabetes of youth, due to the persistently raised c-peptide and strong family history. It normally presents in early adulthood and 1/3 of cases can be treated with oral hypoglycaemics, such as sulphonylureas. It is therefore important to see the response to sulphonylureas first before commencing insulin therapy

## Question #292

A 19-year-old woman is brought to the endocrinology clinic. She has had episodes of feeling weak and needing a sweet drink to improve. This has been occurring frequently since she was rejected from applications to medical school. She has had problems with anxiety previously, but the parents have become concerned as they have once used the patient's sister's glucose monitoring equipment, as she has type 1 diabetes, and found the patient to have capillary glucose as low as 2mmol/l. They have become concerned that the patient may have an insulinoma after reading about this on the internet, and therefore insisted on an endocrinology referral from the GP. Which investigation is best suited to exclude insulinoma?

- a. CT abdomen
- b. Capillary blood glucose monitoring over 48 hours
- c. Post-prandial serum insulin and C-peptide
- d. Supervised fasting with serum insulin and C-peptide
- e. Synacthen test

Answer is D.

Elevated C-peptide in fasting hypoglycaemia is suggestive of insulinoma

This patient has episodes of hypoglycaemia. There are several causes for hypoglycaemia, including insulinoma, liver failure, Addison's disease, alcohol and use of oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin. Whilst insulinomas can cause episodes of hypoglycaemia, commonly associated with rapid weight gain and MEN-1, other explanations should also be considered. As this patient has a relative with type 1 diabetes she may have an opportunity to acquire insulin and use this herself. The most appropriate investigation to differentiate between the two is supervised fasting with monitoring of blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide can demonstrate or exclude insulinoma. If the patient were to have an insulinoma, then during fasting the blood glucose would become low, with elevated serum insulin and C-peptide, as C-peptide corresponds to endogenous rather than exogenous insulin. If the patient had hypoglycaemia during a fast with elevated insulin but low C-peptide the diagnosis would more likely be exogenous insulin use. A CT scan of the abdomen can be used if insulinoma is suspected following supervised fasting. Synacthen testing should be used to suspected Addison's disease.

## Question #293

A 68-year-old gentleman presents with severe abdominal pain. He has a past medical history of depression and type 2 diabetes. His medications include; levemir, sitagliptin and gliclazide. He denies smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use. He also claims he has been taking all his diabetic medications.

On examination he is overweight. He has dry mucus membranes. He has generalised abdominal pain with no rebound or guarding. His bowel sounds are present and normal. His blood pressure is 101/76 mmHg, his pulse rate is 113 beats per minute and his temperature is 37.8ºC.

What is the likely underlying diagnosis?

- a) Diabetic ketoacidosis
- b) Perforated small bowel
- c) Drug induced pancreatitis
- d) Acute hepatitis
- e) Alcohol induced pancreatitis

Answer: Sitagliptiin induced pancreatitis.

Patients with perforated small bowel or DKA can present with a raised amylase. The level suggests the cause is most likely pancreatitis. A perforated small bowel would more likely show free gas on a Chest X ray, diminished bowel sounds and guarding. Diabetic ketoacidosis would show more ketones on urinalysis and is rare, although still possible, in type 2 diabetics.

The gentleman has no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction. This combined with a normal liver function tests makes gallstone unlikely. The patient denies alcohol intake and non-alcoholic fatty liver can produce the appearances on ultrasound scan.

Both dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) and glucagon like peptide-1 agonists have been linked to pancreatitis. They are still both under investigation but is to be discontinued in the event of an episode of pancreatitis.

## Question #294

You are asked to review a 42- year- old alcoholic who has been admitted to the medical ward following 48hrs of vomiting, generalised muscle weakness and palpitations. Despite two calcium infusions, the most recent measured calcium is still 1.89 mmol/l. On examination his blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg, pulse is 95 beats per minute and regular. You note intermittent runs of SVT on his cardiac monitor.

Other urea and electrolytes are shown below:

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

- a. IV calcium
- b. IV magnesium
- c. IV potassium
- d. IV phosphate
- e. IV glucose

Answer is B.

Magnesium deficiency causes hypocalcaemia

Long term alcoholism as well as leading to falls in serum calcium, can also lead to significant falls in magnesium, which can account both for the persistently decreased calcium despite replacement, and for the runs of SVT seen here. The most appropriate next step is magnesium replacement, which is likely to facilitate both an improvement in calcium and resolution of SVT.

Further IV calcium will be ineffective without first replacing magnesium, and potassium is within the normal range, as is glucose. Phosphate replacement may be required in the treatment of alcoholism, but this is usually in the context of refeeding syndrome.

## Question #295

A 19-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency department. The patient himself was too unwell to provide a coherent history but his mother reports that he had been very unwell with loss of appetite and abdominal pain for the past two days. She had also noted a significant weight loss in her son over the past six months and that he had been unusually fatigued over the same time period. The patient had no previous family history although his older sister had recently been diagnosed with pernicious anaemia.

Examination showed the patient to be tachypnoeic and tachycardic with a central capillary refill time of six seconds. Respiratory and cardiovascular examination was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed some inconsistent tenderness without obvious signs of localised peritonism.

Please see below for results of initial investigations.

Portable chest x-ray: poor quality film secondary overlying artefact; no free air under diaphragm, lung fields clear, no pneumothorax.

Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia at 129; normal intervals and axis; QRS morphology normal; T wave morphology normal.

What is the correct immediate management for this patient?

- a) 1000 mg calcium gluconate
- b) 10 mL 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate
- c) 1000 mL 0.9 % saline
- d) 1000 ml 0.45 % saline
- e) Intravenous insulin bolus

The patient has clear biochemical evidence of diabetic keto-acidosis, most likely representing a first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Correct immediate management is to give a litre of 0.9 % saline to restore intravascular volume while preventing a rapid change in extracellular osmolality. For subsequent IV fluids, The Joint British Diabetes Society recommends ongoing use of 0.9 % saline, in contrast to the American Diabetes Association that recommends 0.45 % saline if sodium level normal or high.

An initial bolus dose of intravenous insulin is not recommended after a randomisation controlled trial evidence found no benefit. A weight-based insulin infusion of 0.1 units/kg/hour is recommended.

Bicarbonate infusion are not routinely recommended in the treatment of DKA, although may be considered in patients with severe acidosis (pH &lt; 7) and associated life-threatening effects of acidaemia.

Given the absence of ECG changes of hyperkalaemia in this patient, an infusion of calcium gluconate is not required. In fact, the patient is likely to be more at risk of hypokalaemia as the treatment for DKA progresses.

## Question #296

A 62-year-old male, recently emigrated from India, presents with 5 day history of feeling generally unwell. His niece, who has accompanied him to hospital, denies a history of recent productive cough, diarrhoea or vomiting or dysuria. Her uncle had been gradually increasingly malaised over the past 5 days and not eating and drinking well. He has no known past medical history. On examination, he has dry mucous membranes and cool peripheries, his JVP is +1cm above the angle of Louis. Heart sounds, chest and abdomen are unremarkable. Urine dip and chest radiograph are awaited. His blood tests are as follows:

What is the unifying diagnosis?

- a. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
- b. Lactic acidosis
- c. Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)
- d. Urinary tract sepsis
- e. Chest sepsis

Answer is C.

This patient has presented with dehydration and non-specific symptoms and a diagnosis difficult to diagnose clinically. However, his biochemistry is diagnostic: calculation of his osmolality, (2[Na + K] + urea+ glucose) reveals an osmolality greater 371.4mosmol/kg. He is likely to present acutely with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and a diagnosis of HHS, previously known as HONK.

There is no evidence to suggest uro or chest sepsis but an infectious underlying decompensating trigger should be considered with a prescription of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although lactate is mildly raised, this is likely secondary to intravascular dehydration and hypoperfusion of internal organs. Lactic acidosis alone does not account for the full biochemical picture. Ketones are present and the patient is mild acidotic. However, be aware that neither is sufficiently significant for a diagnosis of DKA.

## Question #297

A 51-year-old woman is reviewed in clinic. Two months ago she underwent an operation to remove a medullary thyroid cancer after presenting with diarrhoea and a neck lump. Genetic testing showed she has a mutation of the RET oncogene. The patient reports being well and there are no signs of local recurrence on examination.

What is the most appropriate test to monitor for recurrence?

- a) Thyroglobulin
- b) Thyroid transcription factor-
- c) Chromogranin
- d) Calcitonin
- e) S100 protein

Answer is D.

Medullary thyroid cancer - calcitonin is used for screening, prognosis and monitoring

S100 protein is used in patients with melanoma. Thyroglobulin is used in other types of thyroid malignancy but not medullary thyroid cancer.

## Question #298

A 23-year-old female presented with acne and hirsutism worsening over the last 3 years. She attained menarche aged 10 and has irregular periods.

On examination, body mass index 29kg/m², heart rate 80/min, blood pressure 135/85 mmHg. Hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans are noticed along with mild clitoromegaly.

Bloods on 6th day after menstruation:

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 17OH-progesterone | 20 nmol/L (NR<10 nmol/L)                      |
| Free Testosterone | 3 nmol/L (NR<3 nmol/L)                        |

|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 9am cortisol | 150 nmol/L (NR 200-700 nmol/L) |

What is the single most useful test?

- a. CT adrenals
- b. Karyotype
- c.  Pelvic USS
- d.  Short synacthen test
- e. MRI pituitary

ACTH stimulation testing may be used to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia

This patient has hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, high 17OH-progesterone) indicative of non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

CAH is caused by:

1. 21 hydroxylase mutation (90% of CAH).

This mediates conversion of 17OH-progesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone. Loss of function results in reduced cortisol and aldosterone and subsequent elevation in ACTH. This causes overstimulation of the adrenal cortex (hyperplasia). The steroid precursors are forced down the sex hormone pathway leading to androgen excess (ambiguous genitalia, salt wasting, hypovolaemia and shock i.e classic type). Presentation of 21 hydroxylase deficiency can also be asymptomatic with androgen excess become a problem in late childhood i.e. non-classic (premature pubarche, accelerated bone age, acne, hirsutism, oligomenorrhoea and this mimics polycystic ovarian syndrome).

2. 11-beta hydroxylase mutation (5% of CAH).

Raised BP as 11-deoxycortisol has some aldosterone activity. Also raised androgens.

3. 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency

Raised aldosterone but low androgens.

4. 3-beta steroid dehydrogenase

Low aldosterone and low androgens.

The short synacthen test is helpful when 17OH-progesterone is only modestly elevated (if 17OH-progesterone is very high then it is diagnostic). Measuring 17OH-progesterone at 0 and 60 mins after ACTH causes elevated responses in patients with CAH (&gt;35 nmol/L).

## Question #299

A 39-year-old man is assessed in the Neurology clinic. His past medical history is significant for migraine with aura, for which he is taking topiramate. He is not taking any other medications.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a) Membranous glomerulonephritis
- b) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis
- c) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis
- d) Type 3 renal tubular acidosis
- e) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis

Fanconi syndrome causes proximal renal tubular acidosis and can be drug induced

The correct answer is type 2 renal tubular acidosis . This patient has metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia, proteinuria and glycosuria. The presence of proteinuria and glycosuria suggest a problem at the proximal convoluted tubule, as protein and glucose should be fully reabsorbed at this part of the nephron. Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is a consequence of a defect of the proximal tubular cells, leading to incomplete protein and glucose reabsorption, as well as defective bicarbonate reabsorption leading to acidosis. This is the most likely diagnosis in this patient and has likely been precipitated by the drug topiramate.

Membranous glomerulonephritis is incorrect. To diagnose membranous glomerulonephritis, one would expect to see nephrotic range proteinuria (&gt;3g per 24h), and ideally, histological confirmation on renal biopsy. Membranous glomerulonephritis is more associated with NSAIDs and penicillamine than topiramate and is unlikely to cause metabolic acidosis in the context of the normal renal function seen here.

Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. Although this can cause hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis, the distal tubular cells are affected rather than the cells of the proximal tubule. This means there is less of an association with proteinuria and glycosuria. Finally, topiramate is not known to precipitate type 1 renal tubular acidosis.

Type 3 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This tends to be seen in children or as a result of congenital carbonic anhydrase deficiency. It is epidemiologically far rarer than type 2 renal tubular acidosis and is not specifically associated with topiramate use.

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is incorrect. This is associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalaemia and tends to be associated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and NSAIDs rather than topiramate.

## Question #300

A 22-year-old woman attended with symptoms of dysuria and increased frequency. A urine dip was positive for leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose. Capillary blood glucose was 11mmol/L. Ketones were normal. She was treated for a urinary tract infection and returned for repeat urine and capillary blood glucose testing 2 weeks later. Her urine sample was again positive for glucose, but negative for leucocytes and nitrites. Her capillary blood glucose was 13. Ketones were normal.

She has a family history of hypertension and her father has a HNF1A genetic mutation.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate initial treatment for the likely diagnosis?

- a. Dietary and lifestyle change
- b. Insulin
- c. Low-dose gliclazide
- d. Metformin
- e. No treatment required

MODY associated with HNF1A often respond well to treatment with low-dose sulfonylureas

Genetic testing would be required to confirm, but the likely diagnosis here is MODY3 which is associated with HNF1A mutations. These mutations are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The presentation is often incidental, with recurrent hyperglycaemia without ketosis.

Low dose gliclazide is the correct answer. HNF1A mutations lead to a reduction in the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas.

Metformin is incorrect. The main mechanism of action of metformin is increased sensitivity to insulin. Gliclazide is the preferred treatment as the HNF1A mutation reduces insulin production by the pancreas. It responds better to insulin secretagogue treatment than an insulin-sensitising agent.

Insulin is incorrect. Most patients with MODY do not require insulin as there is generally some insulin secretion from the pancreas particularly in early diagnosis. Treatment with a secretagogue such as gliclazide is therefore preferable.

No treatment required is incorrect. All forms of MODY apart from glucokinase MODY increase the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. Treatment to stabilise and control blood glucose levels is therefore advisable.

Dietary advice and lifestyle changes is an incorrect answer. Although this advice would form part of the management, the main treatment would be pharmacological with a low dose of gliclazide. Unlike in early type-2 diabetes or pre-diabetes where there is a possibility of improving insulin sensitivity by decreasing glucose spikes, MODY is not reversible.

## Question #301

A 54-year-old woman is referred to cardiology clinic due to echocardiogram findings consistent with cardiomyopathy. She underwent the echocardiogram after developing shortness of breath and there were concerns about underlying heart failure. She has a past medical history of hypertension, palpitations and anxiety. She has been troubled by tremors and increasing weight loss, sweating and heat intolerance over the last three months and has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and started on carbimazole. What is the likely outcome of her cardiac condition?

- a) Likely to develop permanent heart failure
- b) Likely to develop pulmonary hypertension
- c) Likely to develop aortic regurgitation
- d) Likely to have resolution of symptoms but not of cardiomyopathy
- e) Likely to have resolution of symptoms and of cardiomyopathy Answer is E.

Thyrotoxicosis is associated with reversible cardiomyopathy

The patient has thyrotoxicosis. The hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac complication by a rate-related mechanism. Due to this, patients can develop tachycardia, palpitations, AF and rate-related cardiac failure, as well as cardiomyopathy. All of these problems are likely to resolve when the thyrotoxicosis resolves, and this patient has been diagnosed and treatment has been started with carbimazole.

## Question #302

A 60-year-old man attends a medical health check-up at his GP surgery. He was fit and well with a past medical history of childhood asthma and osteoarthritis in his fingers. His observations were included a blood pressure of 129/80 mmHg, pulse of 82 bpm, and oxygen sats of 97%.

Blood tests were performed and revealed:

| Hb                      | 138 g/l       |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Platelets               | 190 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC                     | 7.6 * 10 9 /l |
| Na +                    | 139 mmol/l    |
| K +                     | 3.9 mmol/l    |
| Urea                    | 4.1 mmol/l    |
| Creatinine              | 92 µmol/l     |
| Bilirubin               | 15 µmol/l     |
| ALP                     | 52 u/l        |
| ALT                     | 26 u/l        |
| γGT                     | 58 u/l        |
| Albumin                 | 40 g/l        |
| Serum corrected calcium | 2.77 mmol/L   |
| Serum phosphate         | 0.90 mmol/l   |
| Parathyroid hormone     | 5.9 pmol/L    |

normal range 1.2-5.8 pmol/L

A 24 hour urinary calcium test was performed based on the results above and revealed a result of 0.5 mmol/24 hours (normal range 2.4-7.4 mmol/24 hours)

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- a. Primary hyperparathyroidism
- b. Secondary hyperparathyroidism
- c. Vitamin D toxicity
- d. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I
- e. Familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia Answer is E.

Patients with familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia may have a normal or raised PTH

The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. Most cases are asymptomatic and blood test reveals hypercalcaemia with a reduced calcium urinary excretion rate (of under 0.02 mmol/L). There may also be normal to high parathyroid hormone, despite the elevated serum calcium levels.

## Question #303

A 27-year-old woman has been referred to the endocrinology clinic. She has been complaining of palpitations over the last three weeks, and an ECG during an episode of palpitation revealed sinus tachycardia. This resolved with a Valsalva manoeuvre. She was offered but declined any beta-blockers. She has no past medical history and does not take any regular medications apart from over the counter beta-blockers and an oral contraceptive pill. She does not smoke but drinks roughly two units of alcohol per week. She has a non-tender goitre on examination. Biochemical investigations reveal an undetectable TSH, free T4 of 46ng/dl and positive thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies. On noticing the goitre, she is keen to start treatment. After discussion, she opts for carbimazole treatment with a view of inducing remission. On starting carbimazole she is warned that if she experiences a sore throat or any infection she must have blood tests to exclude agranulocytosis. What other symptoms is it important to warn her about?

- a) Loss of vision
- b) Loss of peripheral sensation
- c) Jaundice
- d) Worsening palpitations
- e) Insomnia

Answer is C.

Patients taking carbimazole need to be warned about potential hepatic impairment and the relevant symptoms

This is a patient with clinical and biochemical evidence of Graves' disease. As this has been confirmed with positive thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies it would be entirely appropriate to offer carbimazole, radioiodine or surgery. When starting carbimazole, it is very important to ensure the patient is aware of the risk of agranulocytosis, but it is also important to warn about liver dysfunction which may develop and may necessitate stopping the treatment. Rash, headache, fever and malaise commonly occur as well, but can usually be managed with analgesia and antihistamines. Loss of vision could occur in the case of moderate to severe Graves' disease with orbitopathy and starting on radioiodine, which can worsen thyroid eye disease. Palpitations and insomnia should improve with treatment as these are symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

## Question #304

A 65-year-old man presents is referred to the urology clinic with three weeks of macroscopic haematuria. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes. He recently underwent treatment for a threadworm infection. His medications include linagliptin, metformin and pioglitazone. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. He works as a dairy farmer. He is originally from Jamaica.

He undergoes a cystoscopy, which demonstrates an exophytic lesion in the bladder.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the patient's most significant risk factor for the development of this condition?

- a. Ethnicity
- b. Threadworm infection
- c. Metformin
- d. Occupation
- e. Pioglitazone

Annswer is E.

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer

Pioglitazone is correct. Macroscopic haematuria and an exophytic lesion identified on cystoscopy suggest bladder cancer. Thiazolidinediones are a well-recognized risk factor for the development of bladder cancer.

Ethnicity is incorrect. Bladder cancer more commonly develops in those of white ethnicity rather than black. However, black patients are twice as likely to die from bladder cancer.

Occupation is incorrect. Typically, those employed in industries such as textile, rubber, leather, dye, paint, and print are at increased risk of bladder cancer due to chemical exposures. Dairy farming is not a typical risk factor.

Metformin is incorrect. The use of this medication is not associated with the development of bladder cancer.

Threadworm infection is incorrect. This parasite is not associated with bladder cancer. The parasitic infection associated with the development of bladder cancer is schistosomiasis. This is endemic to various tropical and subtropical regions. It is not typically found in Jamaica.

## Question #305

A 22-year-old gentleman presents to endocrinology clinic. He was referred by his GP as he was complaining of low energy and a morning testosterone was low. He immigrated from Albania one year ago and has been noticed to be always tired and lacking energy. He has also found to have low sexual desire after starting a new relationship in the UK. On examination he is tall and slim, with slight gynaecomastia. What is the most appropriate investigation after confirming the low morning testosterone?

- a) Prolactin
- b) LH and FSH
- c) MRI pituitary
- d) Morning cortisol
- e) Synacthen test

Answer is B

A patient with low testosterone should have LH and FSH tested as first line investigation to separate primary and secondary hypogonadism

This is a patient with biochemical and clinical evidence of low testosterone. He is symptomatic with low energy and low sexual desire, and most likely would have erectile problems if questioned. The history of immigration is important as it raises the possibility of missed childhood diagnoses, in this case implying a missed chromosomal disorder. The most appropriate investigation to differentiate primary from secondary hypogonadism is LH and FSH. If LH and FSH are elevated this would suggest a primary hypogonadism such as Klinefelter's syndrome, as is suggested by the description of this patient, but if it is not then a secondary cause should be found. If that were the case, then MRI of pituitary can be necessary, as well as morning cortisol and prolactin. Synacthen testing should be done if morning cortisol is low to confirm adrenal insufficiency.

## Question #306

A 45-year-old woman is brought into the resuscitation room with a Glasgow coma scale of 11 (E2 V5 M4). A concerned neighbour called the emergency services, who found them in a moribund state. The neighbour states that she had seemed low over the past couple of months and that she had been wearing more layers of clothes than seemed appropriate.

On initial examination, they feel cool to touch. Pulse is regular and bradycardic with a heart rate of 38 beats per minute. Heart sounds 1+2 are present. Respiratory rate is 8 with oxygen saturations of 91% on 15 L. Auscultation of the chest is clear. Temperature is 33ºC. BM is 2.7.

## Blood tests return as:

| Creatinine  | 130 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |

## What is the most appropriate management of this patient?

- a. Intubation and urgent CT head
- b. IV hydrocortisone, IV dextrose and rewarming
- c. IV T4, IV fluids, IV dextrose and intubation
- d. IV fluid resuscitation, IV dextrose, intubation and IV T4
- e. IV hydrocortisone, IV T4, IV dextrose and IV fluids answer is E

If myxedema coma is suspected, IV corticosteroids should be given alongside IV thyroid replacement until coexisting adrenal insufficiency has been excluded

The most appropriate answer is 5 as they need treatment of the underlying cause as well as correction of life-threatening abnormalities. This patient is suffering from severe hypothyroidism and is in a myxedema coma. This is best treated with IV hydrocortisone and thyroxine in case there is co-existing adrenal insufficiency. Their blood sugars are low necessitating correction and there is a raised creatine kinase requiring management with IV fluids.

CT head and intubation is appropriate but is not the best option of those above. The other answers do no include thyroxine and hydrocortisone as a combined answer so, although an aspect of the overall management of the patient, are not the most pressing intervention.

## Question #307

A 37-year-old woman is referred by her GP after complaining of a swelling on the anterior aspect of her neck. On examination she is found to have a 5 cm nodule on the thyroid gland that moves on swallowing.

She has a past medical history of anxiety/depression and currently takes sertaline 100mg od. Her mother was diagnosed as having hypothyroidism in her 60's.

Thyroid functions tests are shown below:

| Free T4   | 14 pmol/l   |
|-----------|-------------|
| TSH       | 2.6 mu/l    |

A fine needle aspiration of the mass is consistent with papillary thyroid cancer. There is no current evidence of metastases. What is the most appropriate treatment?

- a) Total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131
- b) Localised radiotherapy
- c) Total thyroidectomy
- d) Total thyroidectomy followed by localised radiotherapy
- e) Radioiodine-13

The correct answer is Total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131 . In the case of a patient with papillary thyroid cancer, the recommended treatment is total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine-131 therapy. Total thyroidectomy removes the entire gland, which eliminates the primary tumor and any remaining microscopic disease. Radioiodine-131 is then used to ablate any residual thyroid tissue and treat potential microscopic metastases.

Localised radiotherapy is not the most appropriate treatment in this case because it may not effectively remove all cancerous cells. Additionally, papillary thyroid cancer is typically less sensitive to radiation compared to other types of cancers. Therefore, radiotherapy alone would be insufficient in treating the patient's condition.

Total thyroidectomy without adjuvant therapy may not be enough to treat papillary thyroid cancer as there could still be residual thyroid tissue or microscopic metastases after surgery. Radioiodine-131 helps to eliminate these remaining tissues and reduce the risk of recurrence.

Total thyroidectomy followed by localised radiotherapy is also not considered the best option for this patient because papillary thyroid cancer usually responds better to radioiodine-131 therapy than external beam radiation. Localised radiotherapy might be considered in cases where there are contraindications for using radioactive iodine or if there are gross extrathyroidal extensions that cannot be completely resected surgically.

Finally, Radioiodine-131 alone would not be an effective treatment for a large nodule like this one since it relies on uptake by functional thyroid tissue. Without prior surgical removal of the bulk of the tumor through total thyroidectomy, it would likely have limited effectiveness in eradicating all cancerous cells.

## Question #308

A 43-year-old woman presents to the endocrinology clinic after being referred by her general practitioner. She has suffered from a 2-month history of weight loss, sweating, and heat intolerance. She notes that she suffered from a cold-like illness a few months ago but is otherwise well and has no relevant past medical history.

Her blood tests with the general practitioner are displayed below:

| TSH     | 0.2 mU/L   | (0.4 - 2.0)   |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Free T4 | 31 pmol/L  | (12 - 22)     |

Her thyroid scintigraphy is displayed below:

What is the most likely diagnosis?



- a. Grave's disease
- b. Hashimoto's thyroiditis
- c. Subacute thyroiditis
- d. Thyroid cancer
- e. Toxic multinodular goitre

This woman's clinical presentation and thyroid function tests are consistent with a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid scintigraphy shows global uptake which is consistent with Grave's disease. Grave's disease is therefore the correct answer.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a cause of hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. This cannot be the case as confirmed by the thyroid function tests and is therefore incorrect.

Subacute thyroiditis is a possibility due to this woman's recent illness. This often results in subacute hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism. Scintigraphy shows decreased uptake in this condition which is not the case in this instance. This is therefore not the correct answer.

Thyroid cancers can cause hyperthyroidism however scintigraphy would show a discrete mass with increased uptake rather than homogenous uptake. This is not the case here and therefore Grave's disease is a more likely diagnosis.

Toxic multinodular goitre is another cause of hyperthyroidism however is associated with patchy uptake on thyroid scintigraphy. As the uptake in this instance is homogenous, this is unlikely to be the underlying cause.

## Question #309

A 28-year-old lady is diagnosed with gestational diabetes in her first pregnancy. Her fasting blood glucose is 5.9mmol/l and blood glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is 8.2mmol/l. Blood glucose control during pregnancy is achieved with diet, exercise and metformin. She gives birth to a healthy child at 39 weeks. A fasting blood glucose at day 1 post-partum is 5.2mmol/l.

Which of the following statements is correct with respect to follow-up monitoring for diabetes?

- a) OGTT 6-13 weeks postpartum
- b) Fasting blood glucose test 6-13 weeks postpartum
- c) No routine follow up unless further pregnancy
- d) HbA1c 6-13 weeks postpartum
- e) Annual fasting blood glucose checks only Answer is B.

Women with gestational diabetes whose glucose returns to normal after birth need a postnatal glucose check 6-13 weeks postpartum to stratify their risk of developing diabetes in the future. NICE recommends that this is a fasting blood glucose. Further follow up will depend on the result of this postnatal check. Even if postnatal glucose is less than 6mmol/l, annual fasting glucose checks are still recommended thereafter.

## Question #310

A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 3 days of fevers and sweating. She has a past medical history of Graves' disease and is not compliant with medication treatment. She smokes ten cigarettes daily and works in advertising.

Her observations are heart rate 146 beats per minute, blood pressure 154/99 mmHg, respiratory rate 24/minute, oxygen saturations 97% on room air and temperature 38.4ºC.

On examination, she is diaphoretic, tremulous and confused (Glasgow coma scale 14/15). Proptosis and chemosis are noted on examination of her eyes. There are bilateral crackles on chest auscultation and her JVP is elevated.

## Blood tests:

| Hb         | 124 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets  | 189 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC        | 5.3 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |
| Na +       | 131 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |
| K +        | 4.2 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |

| ALP         | 122 u/L     | (30 - 100)  |
| ALT         | 99 u/L      | (3 - 40)    |
| Î³GT        | 74 u/L      | (8 - 60)    |
| Albumin     | 34 g/L      | (35 - 50)   |
| TSH         | 0.0 mIU/L   | (0.2 - 5.5) |
| Free T4     | 81 pmol/L   | (10 - 24.5) |

Based on the likely diagnosis, what treatment is most appropriate from the listed options?

- a. Antibiotics
- b. Carbimazole
- c. Propylthiouracil
- d. Radioactive iodine therapy
- e. Surgery

Answer is C.

In thyroid storm, treat acutely with propylthiouracil rather than carbimazole or surgery

Propylthiouracil is the correct answer. The patient presents with ophthalmological features of Graves' disease in association with fever, confusion, tachycardia, tremor, hypertension and clinical evidence of heart failure. In the setting of significant hyperthyroidism this constitutes a 'thyroid storm'. Propylthiouracil has traditionally been the preferred anti-thyroid drug to be used in this setting due to its more rapid onset of action when compared with carbimazole and its additional ability to inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.

Antibiotics is not the right answer. Although this patient has a fever, she has a normal CRP and WCC and infection is less likely than thyroid storm given the clinical context.

Carbimazole is incorrect. This can be used in thyroid storm but is less preferred due to its slower onset of action.

Radioactive iodine therapy is incorrect. This can be used to manage Graves' disease but is not an option acutely for treating thyroid storm.

Surgery is incorrect. This is an option for the treatment of Graves disease but is not an option for the acute treatment of thyroid storm.

## Question #311

A 54-year-old man presented to endocrine clinic with gradually worsening low mood, malaise, and reduced exercise capacity. . He was operated on previously for a non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) resulting in partial anterior hypopituitarism, and had been on thyroxine and hydrocortisone replacement therapy. On examination, he had evidence of central adiposity. He was known to have dyslipidaemia, epilepsy and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and so an insulin tolerance test was contraindicated.

## Investigations

| 9a.m cortisol   | 415nmol/l                |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| IGF-1           | 8nmol/l (16 - 118)       |
| FT4             | 15.4nmol/l (11.5 - 22.7) |
| TSH             | 0.03mU/l (0.35 - 5.5)    |

Which one of the following tests is most appropriate in his case to confirm the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency?

- a) Domperidone test
- b) Growth hormone levels
- c) Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)-arginine stimulation test
- d) Insulin-like growth factor- binding protein measurement
- e) Glucose tolerance test

Arginine-GHRH stimulation test is employed to assess GH secretion in patients with ischemic heart disease or seizures where insulin tolerance test will be inappropriate

The clinical features of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) are non-specific and include lethargy, low mood, poor quality of life, loss of muscle mass, and central adiposity. A low IGF-1 in such a clinical context may point towards GHD, which needs to be confirmed with dynamic tests for GH secretion. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the gold standard for assessing GH secretion, although it needs to be conducted carefully in a closely-monitored space due to the risks associated with hypoglycaemia.

ITT is contra-indicated in patients with seizures or ischaemic heart disease. As a result, an alternative test such as arginine-GHRH stimulation test is employed (as in this clinical scenario where the patient has IHD). About 30-40% of patients with GHD may have a normal IGF-1 level. IGF-1 levels are influenced by age, time of onset of GHD, and degree of hypopituitarism. Domperidone test is used in the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinaemia associated disorders while glucose tolerance test with measurement of IGF-1 levels is used in the evaluation of suspected acromegaly.

## Question #312

A 31-year-old woman is admitted with nausea and vomiting. She is 10 weeks into her first pregnancy. She reports vomiting multiple times daily and has been unable to tolerate oral anti-emetics or fluids for over 24 hours. You suspect hyperemesis gravidarum and commence intravenous fluids.

What treatment is recommended first-line?

- a. Cyclizine
- b. Haloperidol
- c. Metoclopramide
- d. Ondansetron
- e. Pyridoxine

Antihistamines are first-line in the management of nausea &amp; vomiting in pregnancy/hyperemesis gravidarum

The correct answer is cyclizine . Anti-histamines such as cyclizine or promethazine are recommended first-line for hyperemesis gravidarum.

Haloperidol is incorrect. Haloperidol is an anti-psychotic but is associated with anti-emetic effects. However, it is not recommended in RCOG guidance. It has more of a role in managing nausea and vomiting in palliative care.

Metoclopramide is incorrect. This is a prokinetic agent with useful anti-emetic properties. It carries risks of extrapyramidal side effects such as dystonia so isn't recommended first-line or for long courses.

Ondansetron is incorrect. This is an option if first-line treatments are not effective or not tolerated. However, there is a slightly increased risk of cleft lip if used in the first trimester. For this reason, it requires specific counselling and should not be used first-line.

Pyridoxine is incorrect. Pyridoxine has been used in hyperemesis in some cases, often in combination with doxylamine, particularly outside the UK. However, it is not yet recommended in RCOG guidelines.

## Question #313

A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and feeling unwell. She has a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. She is poorly compliant with insulin and has an erratic lifestyle.

## Observations:

-  Heart rate 89 beats per minute
-  Blood pressure 111/77 mmHg
-  Oxygen saturations 96% on room air
-  Respiratory rate 24/minute
-  Temperature 37C

## VBG:

| pH       | 7.05       | (7.35-7.45)   |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Lactate  | 2.8 mmol/L | (0.0-2.0)     |
| HCO3-    | 8 mmol/L   | (22-26)       |
| K+       | 4.2 mmol/L | (3.5-5.5)     |
| Na+      | 128 mmol/L | (135-145)     |
| Glucos e | 31 mmol/L  | (4.0-7.8)     |

She is commenced on IV fluids (IV 0.9% sodium chloride with added potassium) and a fixed rate insulin infusion.

## Repeat investigations four hours post-treatment:

## VBG:

| pH       | 7.12       | (7.35-7.45)   |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Lactate  | 2.2 mmol/L | (0.0-2.0)     |
| HCO3-    | 12 mmol/L  | (22-26)       |
| K+       | 4.6 mmol/L | (3.5-5.5)     |
| Na+      | 131 mmol/L | (135-145)     |
| Glucos e | 10 mmol/L  | (4.0-7.8)     |

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate management choice at this point?

- a. Continue current management and add IV dextrose
- b. No changes to current management
- c. Stop FRII and continue
- d. sodium chloride with added potassium
- e. Stop current management and switch to IV dextrose
- f. Switch to VRII, continue current IV fluids and add IV dextrose

DKA in the acute setting fixed rate insulin should be continued even if BM levels are &lt;14; IV dextrose should be added instead

Continue FRII and add IV dextrose is correct. The patient has not yet had a resolution of ketonaemia or acidosis. The underlying pathophysiology of DKA is insulin deficiency. Without insulin, the body cannot use glucose for energy and therefore fat sources are broken down to use as fuel, prompting the generation of ketones, which in turn cause acidosis. To reverse this process and resolve ketonemia and acidosis, we need to continue insulin. Insulin therapy causes a lowering of blood glucose levels and therefore we should administer IV dextrose alongside insulin in order to prevent hypoglycaemia while allowing continued insulin administration.

No changes to current management is incorrect. Insulin drives glucose into cells and lowers blood glucose levels. We need to continue insulin until the ketonemia has resolved. However, this will cause hypoglycaemia unless we add IV dextrose.

Stop FRII and continue 0.9% sodium chloride with added potassium is incorrect. While this will result in the resolution of dehydration and avoid precipitating hypoglycaemia (as insulin has been stopped), it will not correct the underlying pathophysiological process (insulin deficiency) and the DKA will worsen.

Stop current management and switch to IV dextrose is not the right answer. Stopping insulin will resulting in worsening DKA, compounded by exogenous glucose administration.

Switch to VRII, continue current IV fluids and add IV dextrose is incorrect. It is standard practice now to administer a fixed rate insulin infusion in DKA rather than a variable rate as an FRII has been proven to be superior as it has been shown to have the following benefits:

-  Faster resolution of DKA
-  Avoids titration against a poor surrogate marker of blood glucose
-  Confirms resolution of DKA if the FRII is stopped when blood ketone levels are &lt; 0.6mmol/L.

## Question #314

A 67-year-old man with a history of ischaemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus is noted to have non-visible haematuria during an annual review. He is currently feeling well and is asymptomatic. The urine dipstick showed blood ++, with no protein and no leucocytes. This result is repeated one week later.

His current medications include aspirin, bisoprolol, atorvastatin, ramipril, metformin and pioglitazone.

Which one of the following drugs should be stopped whilst awaiting further investigations?

1. Aspirin
2. Ramipril
3. Atorvastatin
4. Metformin
5. Pioglitazone

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer

The correct answer is Pioglitazone . Pioglitazone, an oral antidiabetic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. In the presence of non-visible haematuria (blood in urine), this medication should be discontinued until further investigations are completed.

Aspirin is not typically associated with haematuria and its use as antiplatelet therapy in a patient with ischemic heart disease should not be interrupted without a compelling reason.

Ramipril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is used for hypertension and cardiac conditions. While it can occasionally cause renal impairment leading to proteinuria, it does not typically cause haematuria.

Atorvastatin , a statin used for hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular risk reduction, may have some side effects such as myopathy or liver dysfunction but it is not commonly associated with haematuria.

Finally, Metformin , another oral antidiabetic agent, can lead to lactic acidosis in cases of renal insufficiency but it does not usually cause haematuria. Therefore, there would be no need to stop metformin based on the given clinical scenario.

## Question #315

A 35-year-old woman presents with weight gain for the last couple of years. She feels that most weight has been gained on her face and abdomen. On further questioning, her periods have been irregular for some time. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus last year. The patient drinks approximately 15 units of alcohol per day.

On examination, she has violaceous striae across the abdomen. Proximal muscle weakness is also evident when asking the patient to stand. Blood tests are taken:

| Na +   | 143 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| K +    | 2.8 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |

The team suspects that the patient's alcohol use may be the underlying cause of her presentation, rather than an endogenous cause, and want to differentiate the two.

What is the most appropriate investigation?

1. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
2. Insulin stress test
3. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
4. Petrosal sinus sampling
5. Short synacthen test

Correct answer is b.

The insulin tolerance test can be used to distinguish Cushing's syndrome from pseudo-Cushing's

This patient may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome as a result of alcohol use, as opposed to true Cushing's syndrome. Patients with pseudo-Cushing's syndrome display clinical and biochemical features similar to those seen in Cushing's syndrome, such as the scenario here, but the presentation is caused by alcohol abuse, rather than an endogenous source or steroid use. Other causes of pseudoCushing's include severe depression, eating disorders, and chronic illness. Of the options listed above, the insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic sources of Cushing's syndrome. It is not useful in pseudo-Cushing's.

The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used as a first-line test for patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome. It will not help to differentiate between Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.

Petrosal sinus sampling is performed for patients with confirmed ACTHdependent Cushing's syndrome without an obvious pituitary lesion on MRI. Blood is sampled peripherally and from the inferior petrosal sinuses and the ratio of ACTH is measured. It is not useful to distinguish Cushing's from pseudo-Cushing's.

The short synacthen test is not relevant here. It is involved in the diagnosis of Addison's disease, rather than Cushing's syndrome.

## Question #316

A 36-year-old woman is referred to the hypertension clinic with difficult to control hypertension. She describes having occasional aches and pains which mainly affect their arms and legs. They have also noticed an increase in their urinary frequency and urgency. Her blood pressure reading is taken at the clinic and reads

## as 175/95 mmHg.

They are currently being treated with amlodipine and lisinopril for hypertension.

Bloods tests taken prior to attending the clinic are shown below.

| Na +         | 136 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +          | 4.3 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Bicarbonat e | 23 mmol/L    | (22 - 29)     |
| Urea         | 6.5 mmol/L   | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine   | 110 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |

An aldosterone and renin test is performed and demonstrates an increased ratio of aldosterone to renin. Based on this, a CT abdomen is arranged. This is reported as showing bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

What is the most appropriate management of this?

1. Bilateral adrenalectomy
2. Unilateral adrenalectomy
3. Watch and wait
4. Low sodium diet
5. Spironolactone

Primary hyperaldosteronism: manage with spironolactone

The correct answer is spironolactone. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia can be safely and successfully managed with an aldosterone antagonist (either spironolactone or eplerenone) as this will reduce the effects of aldosterone.

There is no indication for surgical management in the treatment of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia so there is no rationale for an adrenalectomy. A low sodium diet is a reasonable lifestyle modification for hypertensive patients, but there is an underlying cause so medical management is more appropriate in this case.

Watch and wait would be inappropriate as there is a clear diagnosis and a treatment.

## Question #317

A 69-year-old lady presents for a follow-up appointment. She had presented 3 months previously under the acute medical take with headaches, sweating, abdominal pain and wild fluctuations in blood pressure. She is currently being followed up by the appropriate surgical team and her symptoms are currently well controlled with medical treatments. On examination today, you note a lump in her anterior neck and you are given the following blood tests:

Calcium (corrected)

3.68 mmol/l

Phosphate

0.38 mmol/l

Vitamin D3

115 nmol/l (75-200 nmol/l)

Parathyroid hormone

19 pmol/l (0.8 - 8.5 pmol/l)

You have referred the patient to endocrine surgeons for neck biopsies and urgent review. Her daughter, who came with her to the consultation) is concerned she may have the same symptoms later in life. What should you offer the daughter?

1. Reassurance
2. Genetic testing for patient and daughter
3. Offer annual follow up for surveillance
4. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast
5. Serum bone and calcium homeostasis profile

## Correcty answer is b.

The patient describes features consistent with phaeochromocytoma, the appropriate surgical team would be endocrine surgery, who would arrange for a resection. The new blood tests are suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, the neck lumps possible medullary thyroid tumour, resulting in a unifying diagnosis of MEN 2a. The daughter can undergo genetic testing for RET-mutation.

## Question #318

A 32-year-old alcoholic presents with abdominal pain and vomiting. His amylase is 1200 U/l and he is being treated for acute pancreatitis. You are called to see him as the nursing staff report the patient is becoming restless. He complains of numbness around his mouth and appears to be in some discomfort.

Your foundation year 2 colleague notes this morning's blood results:

| Adjusted calcium   | 1.8mmol/l   |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Na +               | 136 mmol/l  |
| K +                | 3.7 mmol/l  |
| Urea               | 6.9 mmol/l  |
| Creatinine         | 81 µmol/l   |

What's the next step in management?

1. Parathyroid hormone
2. Oral calcium supplementation
3. Calcitonin assay
4. Intravenous 10% calcium gluconate
5. Serum magnesium

Intravenous calcium gluconate is used for the acute management of hypocalcaemia

In the acute setting of a patient with symptomatic hypocalcaemia intravenous replacement with 10% calcium gluconate would be the most sensible next step. Typically this is given over 10-30 minutes ideally with cardiac monitoring.

Checking the serum magnesium would be very useful as hypomagnesaemia would require replacement to also correct hypocalcaemia.

Oral calcium replacement would be an option in asymptomatic hypocalcaemic patients.

## Question #319

A 32-year-old man is reviewed in the ischaemic heart disease clinic having suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. He has been diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and started on 80mg per day of atorvastatin. His LDL cholesterol is still 3.5 mmol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next intervention?

- a) Add cholestyramine
- b) Add evolocuma
- c) Add fenofibrate
- d) Add nicotinic acid
- e) Change atorvastatin to rosuvastatin

Correct answer is b.

Although the 80mg of atorvastatin has clearly brought the LDL cholesterol much closer to target, but LDL of 3.5 mmol/l is still suboptimal given the history of an inferior myocardial infarction. Evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor which interferes with degradation of the LDL receptor is the most appropriate intervention and can reduce LDL by a further 50%. Given his relatively young age and high lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, he is exactly the type of patient likely to benefit from PCSK9 inhibition.

Cholestyramine was formerly used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, it is a cholesterol binding resin, but is less effective in lowering cholesterol than a statin. Both fenofibrate and nicotinic acid have most effect in lowering triglyerides, and changing atorvastatin to rosuvastatin is likely to have limited benefit in further lowering LDL.

## Question #320

A 35-year-old female presents with weight loss and palpitations and fatigue. Thyroid function tests were performed as part of a workup for her symptoms:

| TS H   | <0.01mU/L   | 0.4-4.0mU/L    |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| T4     | 15.3pmol/L  | 9.0-25.0pmol/L |

What is the next most appropriate investigation to perform in this patient?

- a) Urinary pregnancy test
- b) Plasma metanephrine
- c) T3 levels
- d) Thyroid antibodies
- e) 24 hour ECG

Correct answer is c.

T3 levels should be performed where tests show normal T4 with suppressed TSH T3 thyrotoxicosis should always be considered in patients with suppressed TSH and normal T4 levels, especially when patients are symptomatic.

Pregnancy can cause raised total thyroxine but normal free T4 and T3 and would not suppress TSH. Thyroid antibodies would be useful to consider once the diagnosis has been confirmed. Plasma metanephrines should be performed to investigate if an underlying pheochromocytoma is suspected and ECG may be indicated to investigate palpitations but would not explain the whole presentation.

## Question #321

A 45-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. Her GP is currently investigating her for lethargy, weakness and abdominal pain. Her symptoms have been getting progressively worse over the past few months. There is no past medical history of note. She smokes 5-10 cigarettes/day and drinks around 20 units of alcohol per week.

A urine dipstick has already been performed: protein trace, blood +, pH 5.5-6.0

Bloods show the following:

| Hb       | 13.6 g/dl     | Na +   | 143 mmol/l   |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| Platelet | 225 * 10 9 /l | K +    | 2.3 mmol/l   |

| s      |               |             |            |
|--------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| WBC    | 8.4 * 10 9 /l | Urea        | 6.1 mmol/l |
| Neuts  | 6.0 * 10 9 /l | Creatinine  | 81 µmol/l  |
| Lymphs | 1.9 * 10 9 /l | Bicarbonate | 7 mmol/l   |
| Eosin  | 0.3 * 10 9 /l | Chloride    | 124 mmol/l |

An abdominal film is requested due to her recurrent abdominal pains:

What is the most likely diagnosis?



- a) Renal tubular acidosis type 1
- b) Renal tubular acidosis type 2
- c) Renal tubular acidosis type
- d) Conn's syndrome
- e) Bulimia

Hypokalaemia, nephrocalcinosis - type 1 renal tubular acidosis

This is probably a useful 'spot' diagnosis to learn for the exam: nephrocalcinosis on AXR → renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1. As well as nephrocalcinosis, the other pointers to RTA type 1 include hypokalaemia and a normal anion gap or hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.

If you weren't aware of the link between RTA type 1 and nephrocalcinosis another approach would be to work through the causes of 1. metabolic acidosis and 2. hypokalaemia.

## 1. Metabolic acidosis

It is useful to first calculate the anion gap:

Anion gap = (sodium + potassium) - (bicarbonate + chloride)

= (143 + 2.3) - (7 + 124) = 12.3 mmol/l

A normal anion gap is 8-14 mmol/l

## Question #322

A 29-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology clinic. She was concerned about the loss of her period with a negative pregnancy test. She underwent blood tests which demonstrated an undetectable TSH and a free T4 of 48ng/dl. She has a past medical history of hepatitis C but without chronic liver disease. Further tests demonstrate a negative thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies and a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan demonstrates diffuse thyroid uptake. She is diagnosed with Graves' disease. Due to the previous history of hepatitis C she opts for radioiodine treatment. She is warned regarding avoiding children during treatment, but wonders about her own conception following treatment. What is the most appropriate advise?

- a) Any future pregnancy will have increased risk of foetal malformation
- b) She should avoid becoming pregnant for six months after treatment
- c) She should avoid becoming pregnant for four months after treatment
- d) Fertility may be adversely affected due to treatment
- e) She should always avoid breastfeeding

Following radioiodine treatment, patients should avoid becoming pregnant for at least 6 months

This patient has a diagnosis of Graves' disease based on the biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism and the diffuse radioiodine uptake scan. Radioiodine is an appropriate treatment choice, but in the absence of severe hepatic dysfunction carbimazole can also be used. During radioiodine treatment and for three weeks following the treatment, she should avoid contact with small children and pregnant women. She should avoid becoming pregnant for six months following treatment. Following this, the radioiodine carries no risk for her foetus or children. A man on radioiodine treatment should avoid fathering a child for up to four months following treatment. It is important that Graves' disease is biochemically controlled during pregnancy as thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can cross the placenta.

## Question #323

A 47-year-old builder presented with paraesthesia in both hands which was worse at night. His hands felt swollen, although they were not painful, and he had needed to buy a larger pair of work gloves. When at work he found that his hands felt weak. Over the past six months, he had been experiencing urinary frequency, fatigue and increased thirst.

He had a past medical history of obesity and hypertension and his brother had type II diabetes mellitus. His only medication was ramipril. He was a heavy smoker with a 20 pack year history.

On examination of the arms, there was weakness of thumb abduction bilaterally and diminished sensation over the radial three and a half digits. Percussion over the palmar aspect of the wrist reproduced the paraesthesia he described on presentation. On examination of the chest and abdomen, there were areas of pigmentation in both axillae and striae over the abdomen. He had a protuberant abdomen and an elevated body mass index (BMI).

Which of the following investigations is most likely to be diagnostic?

- a) Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Pituitary and visual field testing
- b) Fasting glucose on three occasions, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and a 9am cortisol measurement
- c) Growth hormone measurement and dexamethasone suppression test
- d) Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram (EMG)
- e) Oral glucose tolerance test with serum glucose, IGF-1 and growth hormone measurements

This gentleman has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome with an underlying diagnosis of acromegaly.

The features in the question which point to the diagnosis of acromegaly include the presence of a recent increase in hand size and known complications of acromegaly such as diabetes mellitus (polyuria and polydipsia), acanthosis nigricans (pigmentation in the axillae) and carpal tunnel syndrome.

The increased BMI and striae could be indicative of underlying Cushing's disease, but in this case, this were red herrings.

The diagnosis of acromegaly is made when there is a failure to suppress the release of growth hormone during an oral glucose tolerance test. This test also allows the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to be made. Due to the diurnal variation in growth hormone levels, a random measurement is not helpful in making a diagnosis.

Although an MRI scan of the pituitary and visual field testing are very important investigations and can confirm the presence of a pituitary adenoma they will not confirm or exclude a diagnosis of acromegaly.

A fasting glucose and HbA1c measurement may aid the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but not acromegaly.

A 9 am cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test could be used to investigate Cushing's syndrome and therefore are not relevant here.

Nerve conduction studies and electromyography would confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome but not the underlying cause, i.e. acromegaly.

## Question #324

A 17-year-old girl is brought into the emergency department by her mother. The patient appears terrified after she experienced an episode on waking earlier in the morning when she could not move at all for 2 hours. This was her second episode. She reports no loss of consciousness and was aware throughout the episode. She has no other past medical history documented. She is not aware of a previous episode of epilepsy. On examination, her heart sounds and breath sounds are unremarkable. Neurological examination demonstrated no abnormalities. She has normal dentition and her body mass index is 19.5 kg/m². A 12 lead ECG demonstrated a jerky baseline with flat T waves. What is the most likely diagnosis?

- f. Partial or absence seizures
- g. Guillain-Barre syndrome
- h. Botulinum toxicity
- i. Myasthenia gravis
- j. Hypokalaemia

## Answer is E

The patient describes episodes of periodic paralysis and the ECG characteristics are consistent with that of hypokalaemia. The underlying diagnosis is a rare familial condition of skeletal muscle ion channels called hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, which tends to develop in childhood and adolescence. Attacks last hours and the neurological examination is usually unremarkable in between attacks. The average potassium on diagnosis is 2.4 mmol/L1. Diagnosis is often made clinically in association with low potassium but genetic testing can help if known mutations are present.

## Question #325

A 32-year-old patient is due to be discharged from hospital. He has had his third admission for DKA in the last two years since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. He has come off his fixed-rate IV insulin and started to eat and drink again, and has restarted his long-acting insulin detemir (Levemir) and shortacting insulin aspart (Novorapid) as his pre-admission plan. His DKA was most likely provoked by the patient drinking alcohol and not taking his insulin. This is similar to previous admissions, but he only drinks two bottles of beer a week, but occasionally binge drinks. He has no other co-morbidities and takes no other medications. What is the most appropriate suggestion to avoid further admissions with DKA?

- f) Start metformin
- g) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin degludec (Tresiba)
- h) Change insulin detemir (Levemir) to insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30)
- i) Increase dose in insulin aspart (Novorapid) by 20%
- j) Advise reduction in carbohydrates in diet

Correct answr is b.

A patient with recurrent admissions for DKA can be started on degludec to reduce readmission rate

This is a patient with type 1 diabetes with recurrent DKA secondary to a combination of missing doses of insulin and binge drinking alcohol. The most appropriate and likely to be successful strategy is to change Levemir to Degludec. Degludec has a much higher half-life than Levemir and therefore maintains a basal insulin level when the patient omits or forgets doses. This can prevent DKA. Metformin is not indicated for this patient. Insulin aspart biphasic (Novomix 30) would allow reduction in the number of insulin injections. Increasing the dose of insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to prvent DKA for this patient as the fundamental issue is missing doses, and the short-term nature of the insulin aspart (Novorapid) is unlikely to provide any insulin cover for further omitted doses. Patients with type 1 diabetes can also benefit from DAFNE, a course which helps patients adjust their insulin doses to what they are eating and the patient should be offered this as an educational tool as well to improve control.

## Question #326

A 19 year-old man is referred by his GP to the outpatient department after having several episodes of collapse at college. He reports that during these episodes he feels tired and 'blacks out'. Afterwards, he feels shaky and weak. There is no tongue biting or incontinence during these episodes and the patient reports that he often feels dizzy after standing up too quickly from a chair. The only other symptoms he reports is a sore throat that has persisted for a few weeks and lethargy.

On examination of the patient's mouth and throat, there are some white plaques located at the back of the tongue and throat. His sitting blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his standing blood pressure is 95/70 mmHg. He is otherwise well.

Blood tests are performed and reveal:

| Hb        | 13.9 g/dL     |
|-----------|---------------|
| Platelets | 200 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC       | 6.2 * 10 9 /l |

| K +       | 5.1 mmol/l    |
| Urea      | 4.7 mmol/l    |

Creatinine

81 µmol/l

Calcium

1.9 mmol/l

Random glucose

3.9 mmol/l

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Type II polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- g) Thymoma
- h) Type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- i) Type III polyglandular autoimmune syndrome
- j) HIV

Correct answer is c.

The most likely diagnosis is type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. This autosomal recessive syndrome is a subtype of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, whereby a number of endocrine glands dysfunction. The patient's oral candidiasis is caused by a mild immune deficiency and hyposplenism. Furthermore, the patient has hypocalcaemia, caused by autoimmune dysfunction of the parathyroid gland and hypoglycaemia with hypotension, caused by autoimmune dysfunction of the adrenal gland.

## Question #327

A 78-year-old man with metastatic lung carcinoma presents with increasing lethargy and a number of falls. He describes feeling very unsteady on standing from his bed. His appetite has been poor and he has vomited two times each day for the past three days. There is no diarrhoea or abdominal pain and he denies any shortness of breath. He takes regular paracetamol for pain and omeprazole for dyspepsia.

On examination, he is a tanned gentleman with cachexia. He appears pale with dry mucosa and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is reduced air entry at the right base with bronchial breathing overlying. His heart sounds are normal and his capillary refill time is prolonged to 4 seconds. Bloods pressure is 85/65mmHg, heart rate 86/min, respiratory rate 23/min

| Hb        | 102 g/l       | Na +       | 129 mmol/l   |

CT-chestabdomenpelvis

There is a 4cm mass in the right lower lobe with extension to adjacent pleura. Bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlargement of para-aortic nodes with masses seen in both adrenals. Findings are in keeping with a primary lung malignancy with metastatic spread

What is the likeliest explanation of this presentation?

- f) SIADH
- g) Terminal decline
- h) Addisonian crisis
- i) Proton pump inhibitor side effects

## j) Pneumonia

Correct anser is c.

Metastatic malignancy can cause Addison's disease

This gentleman presents in a shock like state with poor peripheral perfusion. This could be caused by pneumonia but there are no signs of sepsis and no consolidation on CT. SIADH and PPIs can cause hyponatraemia but not cardiovascular collapse. Terminal decline is the diagnosis of exclusion. This gentleman does have metastatic deposits in both adrenal glands which can impair function and cause Addison's. Furthermore, he has hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hyperpigmentation all which are features seen in Addison's.

## Question #328

A 70-year-old man with a history of smoking 15 cigarettes/day presents with drowsiness, weight loss and a persistent cough. His investigations show:

| Na +       | 115 mmol/l   | 135-145 mmol/l   |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| K +        | 5.1 mmol/l   | 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/l |
| Urea       | 3 mmol/l     | 2.0-7 mmol/l     |
| Creatinine | 74 µmol/l    | 55-120 µmol/l    |

| Plasma osmolality   |   270 mOsm/kg | 285-295 mOsm/kg   |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Urine osmolality    |          1210 | 500 - 800 mOsm/kg |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Small cell lung cancer
- g) Hypothyroidism
- h) Encephalitis
- i) Congestive cardiac failure
- j) Squamous cell carcinoma

Correct answer is e.

A common endocrine complication of small cell lung cancer is SIADH

Hyponatraemia, reduced plasma osmolality and increased urine osmolality are suggestive of syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH).

The increase in ADH causes more aquaporin utilisation in the collecting duct system of the kidney. This causes more water to be retained, diluting the electrolytes in the blood and making the electrolytes in the urine more concentrated.

Small cell lung cancer is a common cause of SIADH and is the most likely diagnosis in this man with an extensive smoking history, cough and weight loss.

## Question #329

A 24-year-old nurse presents after collapsing on a night shift. His blood glucose is measured at being 1.4 mmol/l. His blood pressure at the time was noted to be 115/82 mmHg. He has no palpitations and had not bitten his tongue or become incontinent during the episodes. He was shaken afterwards, although did not have memory loss and stated he had not tripped over anything. He also said he has had five of these episodes over the last two weeks.

Blood tests are sent off and unremarkable except for a low-normal C-peptide level and markedly raised insulin level.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of his multiple episodes of collapse?

- f) Sulphonylurea misuse
- g) Insulin misuse
- h) Alcohol misuse
- i) Retroperitoneal sarcoma
- j) Insulinoma

Correct answedr is b.

Hyperinsulinaemia in the absence of raised C-peptide points towards the diagnosis of insulin abuse. Elevation of C-peptide, when combined with hyperinsulinaemia suggests sulphonylurea abuse. To rule this out it may be appropriate to assay levels of commonly used sulphonylureas in urine. Insulinomas are a more rare cause of repeated hypoglycaemic episodes.

## Question #330

A 28-year-old pregnant lady presents to the Emergency Department with palpitations and sweating. She mentions that she has had these symptoms on and off for the past 4 months but that they have worsened over the past few weeks. Now she is feeling worried and wanted to be assessed medically due to her concern she was having a miscarriage. She looks particularly anxious to be in hospital. This is her first pregnancy. She is 7 weeks pregnant. She has had no vaginal bleeding or discharge during the course of her pregnancy. She is normally fit and well.

Initial observations reveal a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 19/min, oxygen saturations of 99% on air and a temperature of 37.5ºC. Examination findings reveal a resting tachycardia and a subtle goitre is noted.

Blood test results are as follows:

| Hb       | 110 g/l      |
|----------|--------------|
| Wcc      | 12 x109/l    |
| Plt      | 245 x109/l   |
| CRP      | 12 mg/l      |
| Na+      | 140 mmol/l   |
| K+       | 5.0 mmol/l   |
| Ur       | 5.7 mmol/l   |
| Cr       | 110 µmol/l   |
| D- dimer | 490 ng/ml    |
| T4       | 21 mU/l      |
| TSH      | <0.05 pmol/l |

Given the most likely diagnosis, how should this lady be managed?

- f) Watch and wait/symptomatic control with beta blockade
- g) Radioactive iodine therapy
- h) Subtotal thyroidectomy
- i) Propylthiouracil
- j) Block and replace carbimazole + thyroxine

Correct answer is d.

This lady has symptoms and biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism. This lady's symptoms predate her pregnancy, therefore it is not pregnancy induced thyrotoxicosis and will not self-limit - she will need treatment to prevent complications to her and the foetus. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated. Subtotal thyroidectomy is a little risky and extreme during pregnancy. Carbimazole, whilst normally first line, has been associated with neonatal aplasia cutis before 12 weeks gestation and is therefore usually avoided. This leaves propylthiouracil as the current safest option. During the second trimester, propylthiouracil should be changed to carbimazole due to the potential risk of hepatotoxicity with propylthiouracil. The lowest dose that controls the hyperthyroid state should be used as both medications can cross the placenta.

## Question #331

A 52-year-old man presents to the endocrine clinic with a 1-month history of polyuria and polydipsia. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications.

## Blood results:

| Na +       | 156 mmol/L   | (135 - 145)   |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| K +        | 3.6 mmol/L   | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea       | 14.2 mmol/L  | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine | 162 µmol/L   | (55 - 120)    |

Osmolarity studies after water deprivation are as follows:

## Results following administration of desmopressin:

| Urine osmolarity   | 322 mmol/L    | (300-900)   |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Plasma osmolarity  | 324.5 mOsm/kg | (275 - 295) |

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Complete cranial diabetes insipidus
- g) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
- h) Partial cranial diabetes insipidus
- i) Primary polydipsia
- j) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release

Water deprivation test: cranial DI

-  urine osmolality after fluid deprivation: low
-  urine osmolality after desmopressin: high

Complete cranial diabetes insipidus is correct. The water deprivation test confirms a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) due to a failure of the urine to concentrate with dehydration (urine osmolarity &lt;300 mmol/L). Following administration of desmopressin there is a &gt;50% rise in urine osmolarity confirming the diagnosis of cranial DI.

Partial cranial diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This subtype of cranial DI is confirmed when the patient's symptoms resolve with desmopressin however the urine osmolarity fails to meet the diagnostic criteria (e.g. &gt;50% increase).

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is incorrect. This condition is characterised by the failure of the urine to concentrate with desmopressin.

Primary polydipsia is incorrect. This condition is characterised by a normal physiological response to water deprivation e.g. the urine will concentrate (&gt;600 mmol/L).

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release is incorrect. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH) is associated with hyponatraemia, a decreased plasma osmolarity (&lt;275 mOsm/kg), a relatively low urine osmolarity (&lt; 100 mOsm/kg), and a high urinary sodium (&gt; 40 mmol/L).

## Question #332

A 28-year-old woman is due to be discharged from the hospital. She was admitted four days ago following a month of feeling unwell with vomiting, postural dizziness and weight loss. Following a Synacthen test, she was diagnosed with Addison's disease. She was started on treatment with hydrocortisone three times a day, as well as fludrocortisone on a daily basis. She has had no other medical problems or treatments in the past. She has been taking hydrocortisone 10mg at 09:00 and then 5mg at 12:00 and 15:00. On discharge she informs the medical team that she sometimes does shift-work. What is the most appropriate advise to give regarding steroid dosing for night shifts?

- f) Take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00 regardless of shift patterns
- g) Adjust to take first dose at waking, then doses at three hours and six hours from starting
- h) On shift days take doses at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00, but also take an additional 10mg at starting shift
- i) On shift days take doses at 09:00, but then take second dose at starting shift and third dose six hours into shift
- j) On shift days omit taking steroids

Correct answer is b.

For patients on steroid replacement when working shift work, doses should be taken from when waking

Patients with Addison's disease need both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Cortisol is highly linked to diurnal rhythm - which is why cortisol naturally peaks in the morning and is at its nadir between midnight and 04:00. Replacement should aim to match the natural rhythm as much as possible; dosing is normally split between three doses, first on waking, then at midday and early afternoon. When a patient shifts their daytime routine, such as working on night shifts or travelling, the patient should be advised to take their morning dose on waking and maintain the timing from there. Patients should not be advised to omit doses, and encouraged to always ensure they are well supplied.

## Question #333

A 33-year-old woman presents to the endocrinology clinic for review. She has a past medical history of Graves' disease which was treated with radioiodine treatment. This finished one year ago. Following this, she has retained a clinically and biochemically euthyroid state. She originally presented with weight loss and insomnia, and these symptoms have not re-occurred. Her GP has requested blood tests prior to the appointment which has shown a TSH of 2.6 and a free T4 of 8.2mg/dl. She wanted to have a review as she has recently stopped taking oral contraceptive tablets and is planning to become pregnant. What is the most appropriate plan?

- f) Advise to avoid pregnancy
- g) Measure serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies
- h) Arrange for US scan of neck
- i) Repeat TSH and free T4 in one year's time
- j) Measure thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies

Correct answer is b.

Pregnant woman with a history of Grave's disease should have thyroid stimulating hormone binding antibody titres measured even if euthyroid as the antibodies can cross the placental barrier

This is a patient with a past medical history of Graves' disease who is clinically and biochemically euthyroid who is planning pregnancy. It is important, even with no biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism, to exclude the serum presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies as these can cross the placenta and cause foetal problems. If they were positive, then treatment should be initiated to control the antibody levels, despite the normal TSH and T4. Thyrotrophin receptor stimulating antibodies should be checked in hyperthyroidism at 30-36 weeks gestation to help assess the risk of neonatal thyroid problems. There is no reason she should not become pregnant.

## Question #334

A 30-year-old male with background of type one diabetes mellitus presents with abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Investigations confirm he has diabetic ketoacidosis. Which one of the following investigations would suggest a discussion for possible intensive care admission?

- f) Lactate 3 mmol/L
- g) Bicarbonate level 19 mmol/L
- h) pH 7.27
- i) White cell count 30 x 10^9/L
- j) Potassium 3.4 mmol/L

Correct answer is e.

Parameters indicate severe diabetic ketoacidosis:

-  pH &lt; 7
-  Blood ketone &gt; 6 mmol/L
-  Bicarbonate &lt; 5 mmol/L
-  Anion gap &gt;16 mmol/l
-  Potassium &lt; 3.5 mmol/L on admission
-  Tachycardia or bradycardia
-  Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg
-  Oxygen saturation &lt;92% on air
-  GCS &lt; 12

## Question #335

A 49-year-old man presents with feeling under the weather. On further questioning he reports that he has been feeling tired and weak for the past few weeks and his wife has noticed that he as lost some weight, although he states that his appetite has not decreased and if anything he is feeling more thirsty and going to the toilet several times a night. Over the last couple of days he has noticed a rash develop around his groin, which is now present on his buttocks. On examination, there are patches of red with irregular borders and crusting.

A fasting blood test is arranged and reveals a blood glucose of 9.2 mm/l.

What is the next most appropriate investigation?

- f) Plasma insulin level
- g) Tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTA) test
- h) Plasma glucagon level
- i) Skin biopsy
- j) Plasma zinc level

## Correct answer is c.

This patient has a diagnosis of a glucagonoma. The polydipsia and polyuria, coupled with the fasting blood glucose result suggest diabetes and the rash is necrolytic migratory erythema a symptom which is the presenting problem in up to 70% of cases of glucagonoma.

## Question #336

A 22-year-old woman attends the clinic with a 12-month history of infertility and irregular periods. She also complains of excess hair growth over her face and chest. Observations are as follows: heart rate 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, SpO2 98% (on air), temperature 37.2ºC.

Blood results are as follows:

| Hb                     | 125 g/L       | Male: (135-180) Female: (115 - 160)   |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platelets              | 228 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)                           |
| WBC                    | 8.2 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)                          |
| Na +                   | 132 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)                           |
| K +                    | 5.1 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)                           |
| Urea                   | 6.2 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)                           |
| Creatinine             | 74 µmol/L     | (55 - 120)                            |
| CRP                    | 2 mg/L        | (< 5)                                 |
| Glucose                | 5.2 mmol/L    | (4-7)                                 |
| Early morning cortisol | 140 nmol/l    | (>350)                                |

## What investigation is required?

- f) ACTH stimulation testing
- g) Dexamethasone suppression test
- h) Karyotyping
- i) Serum prolactin
- j) Transvaginal ultrasound

Correct answer Is a.

ACTH stimulation testing may be used to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia

ACTH stimulation testing is correct. The clinical and biochemical features suggest non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This form is milder, more common, and often diagnosed in later childhood or early adulthood. Usually, women with non-classic CAH present with signs of excess androgens (i.e., excess body hair, early puberty, irregular periods). Hypoaldosteronism (e.g. hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis) can also occur. The biochemical features and low early morning cortisol in this case are highly suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.

Dexamethasone suppression test is incorrect. Although Cushing's disease remains within the differential diagnosis, there are no other clinical (e.g. hypertension, proximal myopathy, weight gain, easy bruising) or biochemical features (e.g. hyperglycaemia, hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia) to support this diagnosis. Furthermore, the low early morning cortisol makes this an unlikely diagnosis.

Karyotyping is incorrect. Although Turner's syndrome can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.

Serum prolactin is incorrect. Although hyperprolactinaemia can be associated with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, the biochemical features of hypoaldosteronism favour a diagnosis of CAH.

Transvaginal ultrasound is incorrect. Although ovarian tumours can result in androgen excess, this usually results in virilization which is not present in this case. Furthermore, hypoaldosteronism would not be expected to occur with ovarian pathology.

## Question #337

A 42-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of neck pain and swelling that worsens upon swallowing. She also reports fatigue, tremors, nervousness, occasional palpitations, and unintentional weight loss. Examination reveals blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and temperature of 37.8 ºC. The thyroid gland is tender on palpation and enlarged without any palpable nodules. Laboratory results are as follows:

| TSH     | 0.1 mIU/L ng/mL   | (0.4 - 4.0)   |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Free T4 | 8 ng/dL           | (0.7 - 1.9)   |
| ESR     | 101 mm/hr         |               |

Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies are mildly elevated, while radioactive iodine uptake is low.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Acute infectious thyroiditis
- g) Graves disease
- h) Hashimoto thyroiditis
- i) Solitary toxic nodule
- j) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis

Correct answer is e.

Thyrotoxicosis with tender goitre = subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis , also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, is the correct diagnosis. The patient presents with clinical and biochemical signs of thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by tachycardia, tremors, nervousness, low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, palpitations, suppressed TSH, and elevated free T4 levels. These symptoms, in conjunction with an enlarged tender thyroid gland and high ESR level, are indicative of de Quervain's thyroiditis. Typically following a viral infection (not specified in this scenario), this condition is characterised by an initial phase of thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. Management often involves symptomatic relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and betablockers.

Acute infectious thyroiditis , or suppurative thyroiditis, is a rare and potentially serious condition usually seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Gram-positive bacterial infections mainly cause it. Symptoms include sudden-onset fever, chills, malaise, a tender, painful thyroid gland, and signs of hyperthyroidism. In severe cases, the infection causes compression on adjacent structures, leading to dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. It is important to note that de Quervain's thyroiditis has a gradual onset of symptoms and does not cause compression symptoms, making acute infectious thyroiditis less likely.

Graves' disease is not the appropriate diagnosis here. Despite the biochemical and clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, specific anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and a low radioactive iodine uptake are inconsistent with this condition.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a relevant differential diagnosis; however, it typically presents with a painless goitre. In de Quervain's thyroiditis, mild elevations in antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies may be observed in fewer than 25% of cases. By contrast, these antibody levels are significantly higher in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Solitary toxic nodule is not consistent with this case presentation. Such nodules are generally single, palpable and non-tender associated with thyrotoxicosis. In contrast to this condition, the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and tender with no palpable; the findings align with de Quervain's thyroiditis rather than a solitary toxic nodule.

## Question #338

A 62-year-old man comes to the Emergency department with nausea and vomiting which has steadily worsened over the past 2-3 weeks. He had Type 2 diabetes for the past 7 years and is currently treated with metformin, sitagliptin and empagliflozin. He tells you he has lost some 5kg in weight over the past month. On examination his blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, his pulse is 85 beats per minute and regular. Emergency blood testing reveal elevated ketones and a glucose of 12.2 mmol/l.

Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his glucose control?

- f) Add liraglutide
- g) Add long-acting insulin
- h) Change the empagliflozin for liraglutide
- i) Change the empagliflozin for long-acting insulin
- j) Stop the metformin

## Correct answer is d.

Given the duration of Type 2 diabetes and the fact that patient has lost weight in the past month, the possibility that he is insulinopenic is raised. In this situation, calorie loss and metabolic disturbance can be exacerbated by the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and patients may present as here, with euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The SGLT-2 inhibitor should be withdrawn, and given he is insulinopaenic, long-acting insulin added.

In this situation the empagliflozin must be withdrawn, therefore options including adding liraglutide and long-acting insulin are incorrect. GLP-1 agonists such as liraglutide work less well in patients who are relatively insulinopenic, so liraglutide is incorrect. Stopping the metformin won't remove the cause of ketosis, the empagliflozin.

## Question #339

A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents for review. As part of his annual health check he has a U&amp;E, HbA1c and cholesterol check done. The following results are obtained:

His blood pressure today is 128/78 mmHg. His only regular medication is ramipril 5mg od.

| Na +              | 142 mmol/l         |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| K +               | 4.6 mmol/l         |
| Urea              | 5.2 mmol/l         |
| Creatinine        | 88 µmol/l          |
| Total cholesterol | 5.2 mmol/l         |
| HbA1c             | 45 mmol/mol (6.3%) |

His 10-year QRISK2 score is 7%. What is the most appropriate action following these results?

- f) Start atorvastatin 20mg on
- g) Arrange a fasting glucose sample
- h) Diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus
- i) Increase the dose of ramipril
- j) Add amlodipine 5mg od

Correct answer is b.

His QRISK2 score is &lt; 10% so no action needs taking about his cholesterol. His blood pressure is also well controlled

## . Question #340

A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a collapse at the local supermarket. She tells you that she always feels weak and washed out, and hardly ever has any energy. She takes no regular medication and virtually never sees the doctor. On examination her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. She is slim with a body mass index of 21 kg/m², no abnormal physical signs are noted.

## Investigations

| HCO3 -      | 32 mmol/l    |
| Urea        | 5.9 mmol/l   |
| Creatinin e | 85 µmol/l    |

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Conn's syndrome
- g) Cushing's syndrome
- h) Gitelman's syndrome
- i) Liddle's syndrome
- j) Renal tubular acidosis type

Correct answer is c.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

This patient has hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal / low blood pressure. This fits best with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Bartter's syndrome often presents in infancy as failure to thrive, and isn't listed as a distractor. Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option. Gitelman's is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter, and results in a clinical picture similar to that expected with thiazide diuretic use.

Conn's syndrome is associated with hypertension, as is Liddle's syndrome, effectively ruling them out as diagnoses here. Renal tubular acidosis type 1 is associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis, not with a bicarbonate of 32.

## Question #341

A 75-year-old man with a history of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia was admitted to the emergency department with confusion. His daughter states that this has come on slowly over the last week and prior to this he had no memory problems. He currently takes metformin, ramipril, amlodipine and atorvastatin.

On examination, he smells strongly of urine and his mucous membranes appear dry. His abbreviated mental test score is 7 out of 10 and he is oriented in person but not in place or time. His heart rate is 95 per minute and his blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg. His chest is clear and has a soft ejection systolic murmur which does not radiate. His jugular venous pressure is not visible and he has mild ankle oedema. He has diffuse tenderness in the lower abdomen with no peritonism and normal bowel sounds. He has no focal neurology.

Investigation results are as follows:

Chest x-ray: Clear lung fields.

Urine dip:

| Glucose     | +++   |

| Creatinin e | 137 µmol/l   |
| Glucose     | 32 mmol/l    |
| Ketones     | 2 mmol/l     |

Which would be the most appropriate initial resuscitation measure?

- f) 0.45% saline
- g) 0.9% saline
- h) Fixed rate insulin and 0.9% saline
- i) Hartmann's
- j) Sliding scale insulin and 0.9% saline

Correct answer is b.

This gentleman has hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), likely precipitated by urinary tract infection and his pre-existing diabetes.

According to the Joint British Diabetes Society Guidelines for HHS, 0.9% saline is the recommended initial resuscitation fluid, aiming for 3-6 litres positive at 12 hours. This should only be switched to 0.45% saline if osmolality is not declining despite positive fluid balance. Fixed rate insulin should only be added if glucose fails to fall with fluid.

## Question 342

A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department feeling very hot, weight loss and nausea. She has a past medical history of cardiomyopathy for which she an ICD inserted and takes amiodarone due to recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Blood tests show an undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone. She also has rheumatoid arthritis. She has previously had an angiogram showing no evidence of coronary artery disease. She takes methotrexate, aspirin, paracetamol, omeprazole, warfarin and bisoprolol. She is suspected of having acute thyrotoxicosis. What is the most appropriate action in regards to her current medication in addition to stopping amiodarone?

- f) Stop aspirin
- g) Stop omeprazole
- h) Stop bisoprolol
- i) Stop warfarin
- j) Stop paracetamol

Correct answer is a.

In acute thyrotoxicosis, stop aspirin as it can worsen the storm by displacing T4 from thyroid binding globulin

This patient with acute thyrotoxicosis should have amiodarone, the likely cause, of her hyperthyroidism stopped. In addition, aspirin should be stopped. Aspirin binds to thyroxine-binding globulin and displaces bound T4, thereby increasing the levels of free T4.

## Question #343

A 20-year-old female presented to the accident and emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and lethargy. On further questioning she stated that she had been generally unwell for the last four months during which time she lost 10 Kg in weight and had been tired all the time.

Last month she has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was prescribed levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.

Her mother and sister have hypothyroidism and take thyroxine. On examination, she looks unwell and dehydrated.

Her pulse is 105 beats per minute and blood pressure is 70/40 mmHg

Her temperature is 37.6ºC and BMI is 19 kg/m². Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination were normal. Investigations done last month showed:

| Hb         | 9.5 g/dl      |
|------------|---------------|
| MCV        | 105 fl        |
| Platelet s | 190 * 10 9 /l |
| WBC        | 4.5 * 10 9 /l |

Serum free T4

8.5 pmol/l

Serum TSH

5.5 mU/l

While awaiting new investigations, what is the most appropriate immediate treatment for this patient?

- f) Intravenous glucose 10%
- g) Intravenous normal saline
- h) Intravenous normal saline and antibiotics
- i) Intravenous normal saline and hydrocortisone
- j) Intravenous thyroxine

Correct answer is d.

This patient presented with Addisonian crisis (abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration and hypotension). She has been complaining of tiredness and weight loss (which are features of Addisons disease) for four months but what precipitated the crisis is the thyroxine given for the presumed hypothyroidism.

Actually, a slightly raised TSH and a decreased T4 are features of primary hypoadrenalism and do not necessarily indicate frank hypothyroidism.

This is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately with intravenous normal saline and hydrocortisone. Thyroxine should not be given as it will exacerbate the condition.

Her low haemoglobin and high MCV may point towards pernicious anaemia which is an autoimmune disease seen sometimes in association with Addisons disease.

## Question #344

A 48-year-old woman is referred to the endocrinology clinic with a 6-week history of weight gain and fatigue.

Her observations are as follows:

-  Temperature 36.5ºC
-  Heart rate 77 beats/min
-  Blood pressure 171/97mmHg
-  Respiratory rate 16 breaths/min
-  Oxygen saturations 98% on air

## Laboratory tests:

| Hb                | 136 g/L       | (115 - 160)   |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Platelets         | 288 * 10 9 /L | (150 - 400)   |
| WBC               | 9.4 * 10 9 /L | (4.0 - 11.0)  |
| Na +              | 142 mmol/L    | (135 - 145)   |
| K +               | 3.4 mmol/L    | (3.5 - 5.0)   |
| Urea              | 4.1 mmol/L    | (2.0 - 7.0)   |
| Creatinine        | 112 µmol/L    | (55 - 120)    |
| Glucose 16 mmol/L | (4 - 7)       |               |

## Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test:

## What is the next best investigation?

- f) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
- g) Insulin tolerance test
- h) Petrosal sinus ACTH sampling
- i) Pituitary MRI
- j) Urinary cortisol

## Correct anser is a.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is useful for distinguishing between ACTH dependent (e.g. pituitary source) and non-ACTH dependent (e.g. ectopic and adrenal source) causes of Cushings's syndrome

This patient has Cushing's syndrome. Due to increased glucocorticoid production, symptoms include weight gain and hyperglycaemia as seen in this patient. Hypertension is another common finding also seen here. Laboratory tests may reveal hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The best test to diagnose Cushing's syndrome is the low-dose dexamethasone test. This has been done for this patient and shows a cortisol level that has not been suppressed despite exogenous steroid use. Once Cushing's syndrome has been confirmed, additional localisation tests need to be completed. One of these includes the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test which is used to discriminate between Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production. Suppressed cortisol levels following high doses of glucocorticoids confirms a pituitary cause, as opposed to normal levels of cortisol that suggest an adrenal cause.

The insulin stress test is used to differentiate Cushing's syndrome from pseudoCushing's. Pseudo-Cushing's presents similarly to Cushing's syndrome; however, rather than being caused by excessive corticosteroid levels, it is due to alcohol excess or severe depression. There is nothing in this patient's history to suggest depression or alcohol excess. Furthermore, the positive finding following the lowdose dexamethasone suppression test points away from a diagnosis of pseudoCushing's.

Petrosal sinus ACTH sampling is another investigation that can be used to help distinguish between a pituitary or adrenal cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is an invasive investigation and easier tests such as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test should be considered first.

A pituitary MRI can be used to diagnose a pituitary cause of Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the next recommended investigation. Rather, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is easier and cheaper to complete and should be completed next.

Urinary cortisol is used as an initial investigation in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is not a specific localisation test.

## Question #345

A 75-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) due to increased tiredness and weight gain. Her past medical history includes hypothyroidism and hypertension, for which she takes levothyroxine and amlodipine.

She last saw the GP two weeks previously when she was started on ferrous sulphate due to mild anaemia.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

- f) Bowel malignancy
- g) Addison's disease
- h) Amlodipine toxicity
- i) Undercorrected hypothyroidism
- j) Worsening anaemia

Correct answer is d.

The most likely explanation here is undercorrected hypothyroidism. Ferrous sulphate is well known to reduce the absorption of other medications, particularly levothyroxine. Patients should be advised to take these tablets separately from their regular medications.

Although anaemia in a post-menopausal woman should always be investigated, there are no symptoms to suggest malignancy here. Addison's disease would be unlikely to cause weight gain.

## Question #346

A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a collapse at the local supermarket. She tells you that she always feels weak and washed out, and hardly ever has any energy. She takes no regular medication and virtually never sees the doctor. On examination her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. She is slim with a body mass index of 21 kg/m², no abnormal physical signs are noted.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

- f) Conn's syndrome
- g) Cushing's syndrome
- h) Gitelman's syndrome
- i) Liddle's syndrome
- j) Renal tubular acidosis type

Correct answer is c.

Gitelman's syndrome: normotension, hypokalaemia + hypocalciuria

This patient has hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal / low blood pressure. This fits best with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Bartter's syndrome often presents in infancy as failure to thrive, and isn't listed as a distractor. Diuretic abuse presents with a similar clinical picture although it too isn't listed here as an option. Gitelman's is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter, and results in a clinical picture similar to that expected with thiazide diuretic use.

Conn's syndrome is associated with hypertension, as is Liddle's syndrome, effectively ruling them out as diagnoses here. Renal tubular acidosis type 1 is associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis, not with a bicarbonate of 32.
